--------------------
SRS is truly an exceptional management company. They have been extremely accommodating with very specific requests that I have made. Recommend.
--------------------
First time at Wolfgang. Crowded, dirty floors, poor service, it has it all. Only redeeming factor was the excellent crisp Chardonnay.
--------------------
Awesome service and food.  Served with a dry ice fog thing that add a layer of coolness to the whole experience.
--------------------
Decent falafel wrap...but not exactly cheap. And the cave-like sitting area was cold and uninviting. There are better choices in Manayunk.
--------------------
I only go here when I need something that Trader Joes doesn't carry. They are overpriced, and understaffed. Not a fan.
--------------------
Holy bat crap, this place is amazing. Go to place in St. Pete, anything on the menu was good. Food coma!
--------------------
Best chicken you could ever hope for in bourbon st. The chicken is good. The sauce is good. Everything is goof

Service was crappy, and food was mediocre.  I wish I would have picked some other place for my last dinner in town.

Authentic flavor and ultra healthy
--------------------
Finally there is a place in Stl to eat sautéed seafood in  plastic bag! The sauce is a big plus. Good service.
--------------------
Great rolls and sake. We sat in the bamboo room, which definitely added to the experience, if you are able and agile.
--------------------
Sat down over a half hour, only miso and drinks served. Waiting for actual food ordered or someone to cook it ....waiting ...
--------------------
Zero stars for the Chicken Teriyaki Lunch Bento Box.  I have literally never seen a bento box come without rice before.  

Disappoint.
--------------------
We have great food every time we are here. Great milkshakes, ice cream, Chicago dogs, and cheese fries. Super affordable and delicious!
--------------------
If you're a Latino, you're best staying away from this place.
The lady that cut my hair was rude and very unprofessional.
--------------------
Definitely recommend for anyone looking for a delicious meal at a reasonable price. The shrimp and goat cheese crepes are a must have!

--------------------
Super cute place! Employees are very nice! Cookie dough is delicious! This is a must & we are glad we found it (lost while in town).
--------------------
Cheap food and large selection. Unfortunately, they forgot our order, we waited 15 minutes and they were not even sorry about it. Bad customer service.
--------------------
Good and fast service....meat is always very juice ....BBQ sauce is great...prices are reasonable...if you this truck around stop and try you won't be disappointed
--------------------
Excellent menu with locally sourced food that constantly changes. A delight for your taste buds. Reservations can be hard to get, so plan in advance.
--------------------
Great job first day open packed but well organized me and my family will be back multiple times a week. Thanks for coming to reno.
--------------------
Super tasty and enormous portions. Some unique flavors too. Not much else to say but an amazing ice cream store that others should try to emulate.
--------------------
Not the best prepared sushi inthe city by a longshot, but for quick (and I mean quick), cheap sushi with a long menu, Mixx is great.
--------------------
Great place for a drink, nice friendly staff.  Didn't eat there though and would be hesitant to as it doesn't look to be the cleanest place.
--------------------
I love these guys. Tony is one of big help. Had flat tire and he got it fixed less that what his estimation expectation. 

Thank you!
--------------------
Very cute place and good food. Pear cider beer was really good the service was really good and great ambiance and the price was very reasonable

Great service, food was ok..  Wish the soups were served warmer, and my steak was cooked well done, when requested medium. 

However the service was excellent.
--------------------
Great spot for pho! Broth is very good. I ordered No. 51 (small) and it was filling. Would definitely come back again when I'm in Philly.
--------------------
If you like onion rings order them here. Some of the best I have ever have. I also had a Reuben which was very good also.
--------------------
I got the hot shave and it did not disappoint. They do 6 towels and a facial massage with oils in between. Great shave, great environment.
--------------------
Delicious crab cocktail and my husband loved his steamers. 

Only down fall is it is really humid in the restaurant itself. A fan would be nice.
--------------------
Excellent customer service. I wish I could rent from there more often! Had such a great experience verses other car rental services. 

Rent if you can!
--------------------
food is ok, felt rushed, too many tables and not enough space.  its very crowded and frequently had other servers and customers bumping into our chairs.
--------------------
crappy restarurant with awful service and rude waiter. if you are looking for a GOOD BYO italian restaurant, go to La Baia on 17th and Lombard!
--------------------
Great tour! Very informative  (our tour guide Raymond was awesome!) and the food stops along the way were very delicious. Definitely worth the time and money.
--------------------
Amazingly amazing wings and homemade bleu cheese. Had the ribeye: tender, perfectly prepared, delicious. Nice selection of craft beers. Would DEFINITELY recommend checking out this hidden gem.
--------------------
Eat here at least 2 times a week. Servers are always friendly and the food is amazing. I never leave disappointed & always leave with a full stomach
--------------------
Love in n out. There's just a mood for in n out that you have to fulfill sometimes.

What can I say. 4 patties animal style bruh
--------------------
The service here has gone down. We used to go here a lot but now we go to another one. The service was slow and forgotten about.
--------------------
I love going in there just to look around. The prices are a bit high, but the store is like a Disneyland for adults. I LOVE IT!
--------------------
We really liked this place. Everything we had was delicious. Portions were big. Chicken parm was so yummy. Can't wait to go back and try more stuff !
--------------------
My hairdresser was very thorough in getting details of what I wanted. Then she checked frequently during the haircut to make sure I liked it.  I did!
--------------------
This place was absolutely awesome. 75 cent oysters. After 2 dozen I moved to the excellent cheesy grits. Great place to eat. Even better during happy hour.
--------------------
Pleasantly surprised to find Taiwanese restaurant in Reno. Convenient to all of the hotels.  Solid boba tea and authentic Taiwanese food if you know what to order
--------------------
awesome place.  good food. nice people.  rotating specials.  all home made.  what else do you want?  Chicken salad is a great pickup to make sandwiches at home.
--------------------
I ordered the Pulled Pork Nachos.  They were delicious!  Instead of tortilla chips they are served with potato chips...perfect to share with a Beer or Bloody Mary
--------------------
The Tater-Tots were good but not anything I haven't  had before. Burger was satisfactory.  Quick stop for lunch.  Staff was helpful with providing directions to local attractions.
--------------------
I can say this is the best burger of my life!

You sit outside and Goleta holester Ave is nothing special.   But the burger is the best
--------------------
Hands down the best spaghetti & meatballs I've ever had. The atmosphere here is so nice and cozy. It has just won out as my favorite Italian restaurant.
--------------------
This place is awesome. A real throwback. Music is great, 4 stars (not 5) as they don't really offer seating beyond the first 15 ppl in line.
--------------------
Rons still a regular stop for me.  Usually some good craft beers  (excellent this week) and tasty food  (if you know what to stick with on menu).
--------------------
Food is excellent!
People are welcoming, choices are long list. Sandwiches have great meat in them. Hand made toasted ravioli is some of the best in town.
--------------------
Great staff always helps and always nice. Always clean and huge store size. Stays stocked with everything you need. The staff always helps make my custom breakfast bagel
--------------------
Awesome little shop.  The owner really knows his stuff and you can tell he loves his work.  They have tires and other parts you won't find anywhere else.
--------------------
Enjoyed my fish out at a sidewalk table.  A bit pricey but food was good.  Go to Side street in French quarter if u want quieter dining outside.
--------------------
Prompt and professional. On a Saturday.
Simple mirror fix, but they made it easy for me. I have used them in Charlotte and they were great then, too.
--------------------
Always fun to go to their shows.  Entertaining and relaxed atmosphere. For a good time and good food at a fair price this is the place to go.
--------------------
1st time eating here. Very clean, nice folks and very good sushi.  Would and will go back. Service was spot on, sushi was very fresh and reasonably priced .
--------------------
Fantastic sliders!! Perfect size that you can try more than one!  Fried chicken slider, BLT slider, monte cristo and Cuban were all fantastic!  Now for Donuts to go!!
--------------------
I went there for drinks and found the environment really nice with the brewery right there. The beer was good and the waiter was very knowledgable and kind
--------------------
The food here is so great and fresh. I don't shy away from my kids favorite Wonton Soup because i know they take the time to cook it.
--------------------
This place is super cute! I love how sustainable they are. Definitely recommend. The people are awesome and pretty! Not to mention the food and coffee are extraordinary!
--------------------
Awesome food! It was so fresh and delicious. The papaya salad was delicious! Try the curry..simply spicy and beautiful. The service was great too! They have take out!!!
--------------------
Delicious! Best place around for ice cream . Everything is made fresh from cows without hormones and antibiotics . It's cash only, but it's worth the trip to the ATM.
--------------------
I've been a few times and I haven't been disappointed yet. Its for meat eaters, vegetarians, and vegans. It's nice to have a healthy place to go to.
--------------------
The food is delicious but the service has always been pretty slow if not bad which would be understandable if it was busy it's just usually it's not .
--------------------
There  aren't  enough  stars  to  review  The  Pearl ! Food , service  and  ambiance . I  enjoy  every  minute  of  every  visit ! Not  just  dinner , a genuine  dining  experience  ! Pamper  yourself !
--------------------
This place had fantastic donuts! They were very well priced and so soft. We tried the blueberry cake donut and apple fritter. We will definitely be going back.
--------------------
All you can drink brunch? Yes please!

Sat and Sun they got brunch item and unlimited bloody marys or mimosas for $20. Perfect for some Sunday Funday. Enjoy!
--------------------
I was very impressed! I had a plain glazed and a glazed with a lemon filling. I would go back again if I ever find myself in Indy.
--------------------
Great rich food,  but a lil bit pricey.  Everything tastes wonderful but nothing stays the same the menu is always changing.  The most unique donuts you will find.
--------------------
Great place for breakfast! I had the waffle, which was fluffy and perfect, and home fries which were nice and smashed and crunchy. Friendly waitstaff. Will definitely be back!
--------------------
Nice relaxing place to get a massage! Same day appointments are easy to come by! I have never been disappointed with any therapist I have had at the Center!
--------------------
This is one of the best hotels I have ever stayed at.  Clean, polite staff, nice pool and grand entrance.   I can't wait until next year to come back.
--------------------
Best shrimp and grits in NOLA! Delicious fresh juices too. This is my fiance's second time here in two years and he still thinks it's the best he's tried.
--------------------
Perfect place for a date night. The sweet potato nachos and the "breakfast" we're to die for! Really everything we tried was delicious...I can't wait to go back again.
--------------------
This place is so lovely! I went for a sweet and was amazed at the variety. The gooey butter cookies were awesome and the German chocolate cupcake simply amazing!
--------------------
Great spot I've been coming here for years. Top 3 steaks in the city! Nothing has changed even after the name change. Try a chicken cheesesteak for something different
--------------------
Obviously they are doing something right since they have been around since 1958. Great soft serve and scooped ice cream cones, boats, floats and sundaes.
Prices great too.  Enjoy!
--------------------
Had breakfast with the family after a quick stopover. Great food and service (thanks Jonathan!), definaelty a good find that was busy but had no wait on a Saturday.
--------------------
Great happy hour.  And brunch.  Only had dinner there once and it was only OK- probably because I ordered something I don't typically eat.  It'll definitely try it again.
--------------------
the foods great, but no buflight on tap.i love the servers there , especially Jamie White, whose the best server. But again. Lack of Bud light is a big negative
--------------------
I'm not really into the fast food scene BUT Chick fil A is a step above. Great quality food! I don't feel like I'm eating a ton of fillers!
--------------------
Excellent service! Great diner food and breakfast is served all day. Came here for lunch- they were busy but very friendly and hospitable. Easy to get to off the 295.
--------------------
The ramen is okay, nothing spectacular. Service is okay. Good place for a quick stop but wouldn't go if there were other choices. Been here twice, will continue to go.
--------------------
Had the brisket sandwich with two sides and a drink for 9.99 - Great barbecue at an affordable price. Wonderful side such as potato casserole cream spinach baked beans green beans
--------------------
Great food. Terrible customer service. I've been three times and I've had two different older waitresses. Not pleasant to deal with whatsoever. The owner on the other hand is lovely.
--------------------
Great bar Happy Hour 4-7 every day. Wine & Drafts $3, $5 pizza, $4.50 apps. To-go Dinners and lunches are very reasonable and fast. Staff are as friendly as it gets.
--------------------
The Shop is an amazing space! Their attention to detail and services are unbelievable. Plenty of places to have private meetings as well as post up and get work done.
--------------------
Best Pizza period. Love the staff and the beer is always cold and the taps are always maintained. If you want fresh beer and a slice it's only 5 bucks.
--------------------
Good price, great location and good accommodations with decently sized rooms. The bed is pretty firm though and the sheets are super rough but overall, I would stay here again!
--------------------
Cute place, nice servers and good food but dish sizes are waaaaay too small. I left unsatisfied. I don't like it when restaurants are cheap with portions, especially neighborly ones!
--------------------
Good food--loved the gnocchi with marinara
the baked eggplant appetizer was very good too

The service was very slow, but despite this, I'd go back, the food is just that good
--------------------
My husband and I come here often. We love the food here, it's always fresh and the service is great. We highly recommend this place to anyone who loves sushi & hibachi.
--------------------
Excellent food. We tried three appetizers and five entries and all of them were a hit. This prices are reasonable and the service is good. I'd go back again and again.
--------------------
Blew $80 on food for the family was worth it food was hot and orange chicken best I've tasted in a awhile..now it will be the place we get Asian food!!
--------------------
Best Indian I have ever had! The food was fresh and delicious. Staff are very friendly and attentive and restaurant is clean and welcoming. The paleek paneer and briyani were amazing!
--------------------
Ordered a Passion Passport, I love the name! It contains Passion Fruit Juice Blend, Bananas, Pineapple Mango Juice Blend, Papaya Juice Blend, and Raw Cane Sugar. It was delicious and refreshing!
--------------------
Very friendly staff and nice environment although the crowd was light surprisingly the both times I went there. Get yourself a $3.50 margarita after 4 on Tuesdays, they are pretty good.
--------------------
Nothing extraordinary, but if you want some simple Chinese takeout, this is the best place around. The food seems less greasy than you sometimes find and the people are super nice.
--------------------
Waited 27 minutes for three teas (no one else was in the store when we came in and ordered). NO tea is worth that long of a wait, especially in Chinatown.
--------------------
Great customer service! Love my new car! Highly recommend to anyone who's trying to buy a new used car in good shape! Talk to Andy if you want some good help!
--------------------
Good drinks and food. Had the pulled pork and fried chicken po boy. Mac and cheese was amazing. Very reasonable for the price. Great draft list as well. Serves food till1am.
--------------------
Great store if you like 50's-Midcentury modern! The prices are a little high compared to my favorite stores in STL, but this store is one of a kind thats for sure!
--------------------
Great family restaurant feel. Po boys had the perfect bread. We had 3 different kinds and all were tasty. Mac 'n Cheese was good and a little spicy. Really fabulous service.
--------------------
Great birthday cakes...I mean it.
  BUT: The cupcakes and cookies out front tend to be stale at times...although when I have complained they made good on everything. 
  I will go back!
--------------------
Found Player's while driving by. Everyone is very friendly. The service is great. Atmosphere is very relaxed. Great experience overall. Oh and a great shave and cut for a great price!
--------------------
If I could give this place 6 stars I would. Don't let the looks deceive you, great diner food. Biscuits and gravy were incredible. Portions were more than I could eat.
--------------------
This is not Middle Eastern food. Side dishes were awfully tasting, including a warmed up rice, which I am sure came from a frozen bag few minutes before it was served.
--------------------
This place is terrible. Terrible service, terrible food, and the place is dirty beyond reason.  Really hope I don't have food poisoning after eating here, but I wouldn't bet on it.
--------------------
After 3 weeks of working in the area I finally found a place off of Magazine that is not overrated. Friendly staff! Y'all know I love Phò so it's pretty damn good!
--------------------
Steve & his partner are the best! Love that he'll do a bunch of demo racquets! Great prices with lots to choose from. If you're a player this is the place to go!
--------------------
Exactly as bougie and casual at the same time as you need it to be. Come with your Gucci bag or in your yoga pants and slam a delicious cocktail or three.
--------------------
Very good breakfast. Within walking distance of our hotel. Had the crepes with fruit. Would get again for sure. Not sure about the tea. Had a hint of fennel seed to it.
--------------------
not impressed!..... the service was great but the pizza i ordered was not good. i love Stella and Trenos pizza so i wast expecting the same type. no desire to return again
--------------------
Great bar and atmosphere. Bartenders are very friendly as well as the owner. Mixed crowd and staff makes everyone feel welcomed and right at home! The  BBQ truck parked outside is excellent!!
--------------------
Ive eaten there twice and both times it was terrible. Steak was salty, fish dry, my salad was frozen , service awful. . Im really not sure how this place gets any good reviews.
--------------------
I love this gas station. I work at a hotel on the beach and send guests here just about every day. Also it's the only one on Clearwater Beach that's open 27/7
--------------------
I had the carrot cake.... Very disappointed tasted like licorice and baking soda cooking powder. It's too bad because everything looks so delicious :( also didn't like the chocolate chips in it either.
--------------------
Really nice place to get a pedicure! People are very friendly and it is a relaxing environment. Definitely recommend if you are looking for a clean place to get your toes done!
--------------------
Loved this place, especially the Salmon. Only eaten here at Lunch and not a problem. Going to add this one to my Lunch rotation.
Spotless restrooms and the service is top notch.
--------------------
Tried this place the other day the pizza was not very good at all the place before this one was so much better all home made food with it would've stuck around
--------------------
They call a chicken salad sandwich two cubes of chicken with mayo in it and a salad with a salad that is a bowl Of lettuce a salad? Hmm left here hungry....
--------------------
Wow! I never thought my sons phone could be repaired after he dropped it but it is and it took less than a half an hour! Very professional and excellent service! I'm thrilled!
--------------------
Was in town for a week and came by this little hole in the wall.  The pa nang chicken was excellent.  I ordered one star spicy and it came quick.  Will definitely return.
--------------------
This is my favorite restaurant!  I always order their ceviche, which is delicious.  The atmosphere is fun, and the service is great.  Alex was our server, and he was friendly, attentive and thoughtful.
--------------------
It's no different than any other Chinese place. Same menu, etc. this place does have some good lunch specials though, and the food is always ready when I go to pick it up.
--------------------
My first time here! Grace did my hair....and it's FABULOUS! (And my hair is very difficult---super long and super thick). Great atmosphere, too--modern and clean, and no snobbiness.  Totally reasonable pricing! Highly recommend!
--------------------
This is the best location EVER. The donuts are made to order I believe after 5pm. They are always super hot you can barely eat them . Even the next day they are delicious.
--------------------
My wife and I loved everything about this diner. The decor is lovely & the food was great. I had the cheese steak and it was much better than Geno's.  Our server was awesome
--------------------
Came to see my son's band Last Frontier. The staff and food here is top notch!   Had the porkbelly and fish nachos.  Awesome.  Great selection of whisky. Great sound system for the band.
--------------------
Great hangout for wine, cheese, and some music outside.  Tried some of the food - bacon-wrapped dates & brussel sprouts - all unmemorable.  Also tried the sardines which smelled and tasted past their prime - sent back.
--------------------
My husband and I held our wedding reception at Hendel's Cafe and it was gorgeous, just a beautiful night and a perfect place in which to spend with our closest friends and family!
--------------------
Food is on point.  I am deducting 1 star for the condition of the bathrooms on the Friday night I went.. Toilet didn't flush, no toilet paper or paper towels and overall gross.
--------------------
Cute Japanese restaurant in Old City. Fresh sushi and amazing ramen. Wonderful customer service! This is my new favorite go to for sushi and ramen. There is a great selection on the menu.
--------------------
This is a nice Indian buffet with a pretty wide selection.  There is nothing that will make you say "wow", but many good Indian dishes for a very reasonable price.  Would return again.
--------------------
There's been three times that I've ordered a green tea lemonade and got a peach tea lemonade and had to turn all the way back and go inside and have theme remake it.
--------------------
Salad was good.  Pizza is not good!  Boring, tasteless and just unsatisfying.  Very disappointed.  Also on a chilly night it is a cold interior.  This was my third try there.  Won't go back
--------------------
Creative food and good. We get coffee or tea while we wait to be seated and even that is a cut above.  We love their Bloody Marys too.  Always interesting and an adventure.
--------------------
Love, Love, LOVE this store!!!  I admit, I'm an addict. But where else can you get a Bebe top, a Banana Republic skirt and a BCBG skirt for $4.13?????  The savings are ridiculous!
--------------------
OMG! Breakfast pizza and bottomless mimosas and bloody marys. Is there anything better in this world? Even got a handshake on the way out the door. Service like that seems scarce these days
--------------------
We get high on the beauty of this amazing high desert oasis! Nature's drama in the Catalina Mountains. We come here to run or hike. We're #MCLifeTucson - we love it in the canyon!
--------------------
Haven't eaten at Wendy's in a long time but these have really changed for the better. Fries with sea salt!  Really good quality for fast food. Normally I don't even rate fast food!!!
--------------------
My brother and I ate here to celebrate my college graduation and I must say I was very satisfied. Great vibes in the restaurant, our waiter was outstanding, and the food was delish.
--------------------
Great food and excellent service. Only knock I would give them was they brought out our entrees about 10 minutes after our apps came so we were still eating that, otherwise great experience
--------------------
Farmhouse, rustic, chic.Helpful staff with great ideas to decorate your home. Prices reasonable. Store has items from Joanna Gaines ( Fixer Upper) and much more. Finally a good home store in SB with reasonable prices.
--------------------
Westfall replaced our roof in April. We could not be more pleased with the entire process. Quality roof, excellent communication and excellent follow up. Very happy we chose this company to replace our roof.
--------------------
Took a while to get actual service but once we did I was happy. The gumbo was awesome and loved the chicken & waffles. Friendly staff and right on Bourbon St for good people watching!
--------------------
We sat at a pretty hectic lunch at Johnny rockets in the casino. Our server was Lyndel! She was awesome! Helped us at every needy request lol... Good was good, too! I'm too full
--------------------
This place is fantastic. The food is exceptional and the service couldn't be better. Very nice and generous people with a cool atmosphere. I eat here almost every weekend. Can't beat the Cuban espresso!
--------------------
Good, but expensive. 

We both had steak, and it was pretty darn good. 

The guacamole is nothing special. Yes, it gets made in front of you, but it gets made wrong in my opinion.
--------------------
Great classic Greek diner. The Greek omelette with feta, gyro meat, tomato and spinach was super. Classic griddle home fries and outstanding service. We will seek it out when we return to the area.
--------------------
We stopped by a couple of weeks ago for Sunday brunch.  The food was very good and filling.  Nice drinks, and we had a very pleasant server.  Cool cafe space.  Overall a good recommend.
--------------------
Soooooo good! Tuesday is the night to go! Selection of 1/2 price tapas and Sangria/margaritas are $5.00. 
We loved the Fried Manchego, Hot Cauiliflower, and Camarones! 
This was over the top unique and tasty!!
--------------------
Great burgers,fries and salad!  Burgers have a hint of salt and pepper flavor.

This location is very quaint. They only have outdoor seating

Friendly staff.

Street parking as well as parking lot in the back.
--------------------
They have the WORST service advisors! Used to be good before Kelly and her team left. Unfortunately, it's convenient to work if I need oil change before I can make it to another Honda dealer.
--------------------
Thoroughly enjoyed our private tour today with Carrie (it was very rainy so not too many visitors).  Her knowledge and passion about the Civil War was captivating. The Battle of Franklin deserves such a memorial.
--------------------
Came here on a Monday at lunch time. I sat at the bar and received fast service. Ordered their carne asada taco lunch special which were better than average. More than pleased with this place
--------------------
Quaint place with great ambience, food and service. I had the Shrimp Po Boy. It was delicious. The fries and cole slaw were perfect side dishes. This was my first visit. Definitely not my last.
--------------------
I highly recommend this place! This was our first "Chef Tasting"! It was exquisite!! We had 9 courses and all were truly delicious. Wine was amazing. If you are in Philly, I highly recommend Vetri.
--------------------
If you want The Best burger in Philly, this is the right place to come. The bread was fresh, meat was nothing but juicy, service was a amiable, price was descent and affordable to everybody!
--------------------
We have used Reno Vulcanizing for several years now and will not take a vehicles to anyone else. Ken, Bruce and all the other staff I have dealt with are always honest, courteous and helpful.
--------------------
I've only eaten at Cosi when I travel. I've eaten at this location a few times. I like their flatbreads and salads. 
There bbq chicken Flatbread is good. It's a pretty good portion size too.
--------------------
I went here to get my wisdom teeth out and they did a great job. The only complaint I have is that I never see the same dentist. I've been going here for 5 years.
--------------------
simply the best! everything from here is good! I come from a very Italian family and whenever there is a family event, there is always Termini brothers dessert trays! Their cannolis are amazing! Highly recommend.
--------------------
The pasta was cooked perfectly, chicken parm was delicious and pizza was good. What amazes me most is in a packed place this one cashier/waitress was able to do it all seamless and well. Impressed
--------------------
Great food... Love the Fish tacos & Nachos are great  it's really a nice atmosphere for family settings and night or dates too.. Music beach bar, home made ice cream  & a little play ground - it's great
--------------------
I went here based on the Yelp reviews and found everything to be true. The staff is extremely helpful and willing to answer all questions. I will continue to bring my bike repair/maintenance needs here.
--------------------
Pretty average take-out chinese. Not bad, not the best, but id definitely eat there again. ***update--- just ate there again and they got our complex delivery perfect and the food was excellent! 5 stars now!!
--------------------
I was a little worried about seeing the reviews but everything. Was great! Not long wait time. Staff was nice from walking in the lobby and asking which way to the office, to the office staff.
--------------------
Hipsters unite!  I've never had a good time at The Taint, despite several people's attempts top tell me otherwise.  I'm not impressed by the apathy here, or the dirty-headed Garden District crapfest of regular clientele.  Boo.
--------------------
Lots of improvements to this place. Much more comfortable environment now.  The chairs could be a bit more comfortable as it'd be nice to sit through an entire football game. Otherwise, this place has really improved.
--------------------
I went here when if first opened, and have never desired to go back again, I was so very disappointed at the quality and the taste of the food. I would absolutely not recommend dining here.
--------------------
My partner and I split the vegetarian platter and left stuffed! Delicious food, very kind and attentive staff.  Will help you make decisions on ordering and certainly won't take advantage of you. Will definitely be back.
--------------------
This is the best Italian food I've ever had. Very small elegant restaurant, entrees were really good and very tasty cheesecake. To top it off, the entire staff was super friendly. Highly recommended for date night.
--------------------
This place is a lot of fun. I like that there is a outdoor patio with hip hop music and indoor dance area with salsa . If you need a change in tunes or scenery , just move !
--------------------
Listen up, people!  Fall off the bone mushy ribs are not what you get at a proper barbeque joint!  If you want that stuff, then go elsewhere.  Smoked ribs are meant to be a little tough.
--------------------
This is my favorite place to enjoy gelato in St. Louis. 

Consider the... 

Coffee house-like atmosphere. 
Large outdoor patio with a fountain and surrounding foliage. 
Delicious gelato and baked goods. 

Yes, everything at Gelateria is pleasing.
--------------------
Wells Fargo is a great atmosphere for all ages. Flyers host a great game every time I got no matter where you sit. I would recommend everyone to a game even if you don't like hockey!!
--------------------
Love this place! Almost all of their menu items can be made vegan. They are super knowledgeable. The Pad Thai with tofu, veggies, and cashews is perfection. The avocado egg rolls are amazing too! A favorite.
--------------------
I eat here at least once a month, and more often when possible.  The brisket tacos and brisket quesadillas are fantastic.  Happy hour starts at 3 if you're interested in a late lunch for 2-for-1 drinks.
--------------------
Nothing more to say than this is the BEST donut place ever. I literally wished they shipped their products. When I moved to Florida, I missed it so much. It's only in New Orleans... sad face!
--------------------
Food was good- atmosphere/decor is like a fishing lodge- menu is someplace between outback & bonefish. Went on a Groupon & all 3 of our meals & calamari appetizer that we ordered were cooked perfectly- we will def be back.
--------------------
Love it here! Their sips mocha is my go-to. Staff has always been so nice! Absolutely love that they have a drive thru too, helps not to unload my kiddos. Oh and their cakes are amazing too!
--------------------
I can walk here and won't go back even if they were the only place open at 2am.  I got the basic general tso's and it didn't come close to passing the test.  Go to East Cuisine.
--------------------
Pancake Pantry is an institution in Nashville. A place to see country stars and have a great breakfast. Pancakes are good. It's a thing to do in Nashville. Plan to stand in line and enjoy the conversation.
--------------------
Tasty brunch, extremely friendly staff, great cocktails, and cute and comfy design. I love having a lesbian bar in the neighborhood. I will be returning with my mom for Mothers' Day. I'm so happy this place exists.
--------------------
Overrated. This place is ok, often the crust is burned...maybe our pallets aren't sophisticated enough to appreciate that taste but it's not our thing. We enjoyed the cauliflower salad and the fried dough ball dessert is delish
--------------------
This was such a nice change from the other restaurants. Simple fresh organic food.  Full coffee, latte, etc options. Sasquatch brew is delicious. Also, very nice ambiance. Casual, relaxed, and comfortable. The owners are amazing and friendly.
--------------------
This is everything I want in take out food - fresh, yummy, and relatively healthy. I also love that there is a good to go place in Northern Liberties that is convenient - there is not enough of that!
--------------------
I Recently vacationed in St. Petersburg with my family. Dooners was definitely my favorite meal of the trip. Great food and incredibly helpful and friendly staff. Would definitely recommend to anyone, and wouldn't hesitate to go again.
--------------------
Please note: the coffee is excellent! However, you have to ask for cream and sugar. I find this pretentious and intimidating. It's coffee. I want it how I want it. It shouldn't be such a big deal.
--------------------
Just got a pedi so I can't speak to the massage but my pedi was amazing. Place is clean and very nice, I did not have to wait at all and most importantly they know their stuff.
--------------------
We have had a blast to each event we've been to.  We've been to concerts and basketball games and other were a lot of fun.  The food is really good, also.  A lot of local favorites are offered.
--------------------
I was here a few times before and didn't review. I come here for the food, NOT the service. The establishment is lacking in its service. Their food is always great though! Very delicious for a dive bar.
--------------------
This is my favorite nail shop in the city I've been going here for years....I enjoy the quiet serene atmosphere...the staff is very friendly and efficient....the price of $25.00 for a pedicure in the South....you can't beat it!
--------------------
I love this restaurant. The owners are the nicest family. The food is delicious!!. My favorite is bacon pizza. I love that there is a play room for my kids to play while we wait for our food.
--------------------
Rude and unprofessional staff. I called today to find out if they had availability over the Thanksgiving holiday and the staff was short and basically said no then hung up the phone. I will take my business elsewhere.
--------------------
Service was good. Mesquite wings are very good  best to share or save some don't be greedy like me and try.and go back to work. Only downside was the weak lemonade. It was the weakest I ever had.
--------------------
It may be a bit pricey, but it's good food in the cafe and a good selection in the grocery. I love their vegan sandwich and tofu melt and they always have a great selection of vegan sweets.
--------------------
My favorite place to eat sushi and the nicest people I know that work there! It'll always be my first choice and they have a great menu! It's always more than just good when you eat from there!
--------------------
these people are great.
through the years we've experienced everything and seen probably every doctor. these are true animal people, through and through, and you can always count on them for the best. not much else to say!
--------------------
Great talent but that is not important when time
Is more valuable. Sitting here on 3/23/18 at 11:28am. Supposedly opened at 11am. There are 5 of us waiting but no employee to provide service. Tsk, tsk Perfect Arch!
--------------------
Dinner for 9 was just fantastic. We celebrated a 70th birthday and received first class treatment all the way.  Sure it was very expensive but our steaks and entrees were outstanding. Great service, great food and great ambiance.
--------------------
After our recent trip to New Orleans, I came back to Reno appreciating this place even more than before! 
The shrimp po boy is my favorite thing on the menu! And their corn bread is amazing as well!
--------------------
Two very good experiences.  Excellent burger and very good pulled pork.  Wife loved her egg white and goat cheese omlette.  Solid beer list and a good spicy bloody Mary.  Also had great service and an ecclectic play list.
--------------------
I've dined here several times but the last two occasions we received poor service and the food was underwhelming. Very disappointing as we used to love to eat lunch here. Probably won't be back.  Not worth the money.
--------------------
First time there and it was excellent!!! It feels like your are entering someone's home. The waiters there funny and nice. The food come out very quickly and it is phenomenal!!! Definitely will be going back to this place.
--------------------
Federal Doughnuts is a new concession at the ballpark -- who doesn't love some doughnuts and fried chicken?  

Also, there is now a concession stand near 136 that is gluten-free dedicated.  They offer pizza, cheesesteaks and even brownies and cookies.
--------------------
A++ for ambience. Very cozy English pub feel. Great drinks too - the bartenders here know how to mix 'em. That being said, the prices are steep (I paid $7 for a standard mixed drink) and the seating is limited.
--------------------
My husband took me here for our Anniversary and it was such a delight! Hats off to the chef for the amazing dinner that melted in my mouth. And the customer service was top notch. Definitely will be back!
--------------------
Food is terrible and too expensive for how bad it is. Took over 2 hours for delivery. Rude on the phone when we called to see about our order status. Terrible decision to order from this place, never again.
--------------------
Mediocre food. very slow service , our food came one by one Within 10 to 15 minutes of each other. Rude servers and took us a long time to get our bills with lots of mistakes. Overall very bad experience
--------------------
I had the classic burger and fries. Overall pleased with my experience. The burger was well seasoned and the fries were pretty tasty. The service was on point. Also had to have a spiked milkshake....my choice the Bananas Foster.
--------------------
Worst roast pork sandwich I've ever had. The broccoli rabe was lifeless and freezing. It was so cold my cheese didn't melt. The bread was soggy and wet. Horrible. If I wasn't in an airport, I'd bring this back.
--------------------
You can't beat the prices for the unlimited food, but I've had better. The sushi is delicious, the salad was subpar and the crab Rangoon was probably the worst I've had. I've been twice and would definitely go again.
--------------------
I always am in favor of local businesses.  They have a big selection here and you get free popcorn.  Why go to the big boys and have to pay for popcorn when you can get it here for free?
--------------------
Expensive but great service & food. The ribeye melted in my mouth. The burger was huge & delicious w/ every bite. The bread pudding is everything it's hyped up to be. Definitely go at least once & share some meals w/ friends.
--------------------
Terrible service from the bar tender. Unless you are a regular she did not serve us. I was standing at the bar with money in my hand and she just kept going to the same old people. Very irritating!
--------------------
got my haircut here for the first time Jessie Becker took the damaged ends off. She's so sweet and does only what you ask of her. She's also great with kids. come see this place and come see her.
--------------------
Wow!  Yummy, different,  delicious.   Our favorite is the lamb curry and korma.  With 10 different kinds of naan!!!  Don't let the outside deter you (because we almost changed our minds)...go in and try something new!   You'll be glad you did!
--------------------
What a great addition to the Funk Zone!  Grab a bite, grab some tastings, life is good. Right next door to the Santa Barbara Wine Collective, in fact it actually shares the same tables.  We had a fabulous savory croissant.
--------------------
We have been here twice for brunch and have enjoyed it immensely. Everything we have tried has been delicious, particularly the grits with scallions and sour cream. But the room is always freezing so be sure to bring a sweater!
--------------------
Three stars not because of food, the food is good but, the service is slow. I think they need 1 or 2 more people up front when placing an order if your waiting and not using the kiosk to order.
--------------------
Becca is an awesome bartender. They have awesome happy hour specials including land shark. The food menu is somewhat limited but the service at the bar is great. We hope they can keep up the business and attract more locals.
--------------------
One of the few diners in North Wilmington, and the only one that probably isn't really bad. I've had totally ordinary diner fare here, and used to come by after swim meets. Nothing particularly good or bad about this place.
--------------------
Sweet and sour chicken and chicken chow mein were both excellent. I like the chicken cuts in the chow mein. Have also tried the sushi a few times and enjoyed it. A little pricey, but at least it's great food.
--------------------
The Lemon Cake is as good as it is heavy.    It was my second visit to Cake Life and I only chose not to get cupcakes because it would have been pure gluttony.   They ROCK!   Many more visits to come.
--------------------
The Smoked Salmon Frittata came with the smoked salmon, egg, potato, red bell peppers, goat cheese, horseradish -dil crema & fresh fruit. And it was as good as it sounded 

A very good mod dat brunch, dinner, and private dining spot.
--------------------
the best frozen yogurt i have found in the central bucks area (at the time of the initial review).  everyone is super friendly and the flavors are good.  but i have since found another location that is a rival.  :-0
--------------------
Hated this place I went in to try an egg roll and get a sushi roll and both were bad the egg was horrible and the sushi was chewy so I wasnt surprised that I was the only one there
--------------------
You need a Cinnamon Roll from the bake house.  You probably need two; life would have just a little less happiness and light without their Cinnamon Rolls.
The coffee and salads are also excellent, a lovely Saturday morning breakfast treat.
--------------------
Great staff.  Nothing is ever disappointing - chili cheese etoufee is the BOMB.  It's a 4 instead of 5 stars because it's CASH ONLY.  But I love that you can also sit outside on nice evening.  

Don't forget the garlic sauce!
--------------------
The Food here is bomb.com on Wednesday they have 1.00 jumbo wings and they are really good and seasoned just right. The drink i fell in love with is the Dirty Lemonade, If you're in Indianapolis come visit this place.
--------------------
Store is severely understaffed
Waiting in line to check out can take up to 25 minutes

Avoid this store if possible

The workers are nice, but they know they are understaffed to make the profits look better as a strategy
--------------------
Comfortable bed, good breakfast, fast internet, great location, and low price. Overall I was really impressed with this place. However, if you stay on the top floors you may be waiting up to 15 minutes for an elevator in the morning.
--------------------
This was such a unique spot, from the graffiti style art on the walls to the delicious food options and special hummus flavors. Good prices, great portion size. I had the greek steak pita with guac hummus. Will definitely be back!
--------------------
Hands down best fall off the bone BBQ I've ever had.Excellent pulled pork everything had that great smoky flavor.Very creamy mac and cheese.Service was fast and friendly. Dessert was equally as good walnut brownie and ice cream delight.Such a great find.
--------------------
Overpriced mediocrity.  Please don't waste your money here.  My family has eaten here twice and both times "corporate" has refunded the price of our meals because it has been so appalling.

This corporation/restaurant has no clue.  Please don't be ripped off.
--------------------
Their sushi is pretty good. Mesa rolls are my fav here. They would be 4stars if they gave better estimations for pick ups. It is typical that they lag a lot and they seem to make it after you show up.
--------------------
Staff member wouldn't let us use guest pass on our first time there. He said our only option was to buy at least a one day pass for $15/person. LOL. Went to Retro fitness for free trial; better equipment and environment:)
--------------------
Stopped for a very healthy burger while visiting Philly after performing a nearby Prince tribute show; discovered one of the greatest burger places on planet earth! Thank you Alya & company at Bareburger!!

This hotel has wonderful views of the airport, and it has the only revolving rooftop restaurant.  It's connected to the airport that has several restaurants and shops.  From the revolving rooftop restaurant, I could see the runways, and the control tower.
--------------------
Great dinner started with a wonderful fresh Caesar salad and bread followed by delicious cheese ravioli with pesto cream sauce. The pesto sauce was perfect, not overpowering the delicate pasta. I also enjoyed the Dunham cabernet. Delicious. Welcome to downtown, Richard's.
--------------------
The decor of this restaurant is pretty modern.  It seems great for people in their 20s.  I had the mahi mahi with pita chips and hummus.  It was really good.  The fish was tender and flavorful.  The service was good, too.
--------------------
Place for latest night eats around and drive through is a must. New menu items and some veggie options etc. forgot to put my dessert order in the bag though so I was very bummed when I noticed far too late!
--------------------
My go to place in IN when visiting family!  David does the most amazing pink and whites!  The shop is clean and the staff are professional and courteous.  The new management is outstanding (well three years ago but new to me).
--------------------
Boulevard Pizza is our go to place in the Sparks/Reno area. It looks like the decor has not changed since 1985, but who cares when they serve you a pizza this delicious! They have some fun arcade games for the kids.
--------------------
Love going here for happy hour or dinner!  Great patio with fans to beat the StL heat!   Also...very accomodating at this location.  I like the Veal Milanese but with mixed greens instead of pasta!  they'll modify the menu to suit your taste!
--------------------
Tremendous service (Big shout out to Douglas) that complemented the delicious food. Pretty expensive establishment (40-50$ avg for your main course), but its definitely backs that up with an atmosphere that's comparable with any of the top tier restaurants across the country.
--------------------
HOLY SMOKES!

actual pumpkin pie mixed in with the frozen custard......are you kidding me? Why hasn't this become a huge sweep the nation treat. 

The best part was the chunks of pie crust. Like finding a diamond inside another diamond. Super yummy.
--------------------
This is one of the busiest Chick fil A's I've seen but they always manage to be quick and have exceptional service! I seriously don't know how they can be so quick and great all the time! One of my favorite places!
--------------------
Cindy is the best! Great food and service. Food is authentic and so is the staff. Everything is made fresh and you can taste the difference from other Mexican restaurants at first bite. I would recommend to anyone that enjoys Mexican cuisine.
--------------------
Called in a Mediterranean chicken shawarma. Good flavor and they were generous with the amount of chicken in the pita. The food was ready to go when I arrived. Good service. I would revisit the next time I am in the area.
--------------------
Best iced latte and beignet we tried. The live music also creates a great atmosphere. We also visited Cafe du Monde but in our opinion Cafe Beignet is much better. The service is also very good and there are hardly ever lines.
--------------------
Called in to get service information on my 2015 $110K AMG. Was told since I didn't purchase the vehicle at their dealership that I would have to pay for a loaner car for warranty work. Will be staying far away from here.
--------------------
Out lunch today was pulled pork, smokehouse bowl, and delicious sides of sweet potato casserole and red beans and rice.   Red beans and rice was spicy but good. Sweet potato casserole yummy and meat was smoky juicy and plentiful. Definitely a must.
--------------------
Got an estimate but went with another plumber as this was the highest quote of the 3 plumbers we interviewed for the job.
Very prompt communication though.

Will re-consider for future jobs.  Seems reliable (and often you get what you pay for!)
--------------------
I love this place. Super friendly staff. Great with kids. And the food is amazing. Especially the hash browns. You can also get tomatoes and grits on the side. Yum! And on top of it all it's not hard on the wallet.
--------------------
I had chicken BBQ burritos with all kinds of stuff that I like. I love the it ! Good place to sit down with family & had a meal. I wish they had a place for kids to play that would be even better !
--------------------
I visited the new Paoli location. BIG selection of tasty donuts. It's about time--the cardboard impostors found at Dunkin are so lame compared to these beauties. Salted Caramel, Bacon Maple, Lemon--now you're talking my language. Breakfast sandwiches, muffins, and bagels, oh my.
--------------------
Had a great lunch here. I ordered a chicken Caesar and my dining companion ordered a custom salad. Waitress had a great personality and did not rush us at all. Allowed us to linger. Great space which is hidden from the outside.
--------------------
Hands down the best veggie wings I've had anywhere. Seriously. I can never stop thinking about them. Their fried pickles are also great, though I've found their drinks to be a bit weak. I'll stick to a Mexican coke whenever I'm here.
--------------------
I am conflicted about this. Driver was so sweet and polite and the pizza was delicious BUT it was BARELY warm. This is the second time this has happened. I hope they fix it, but for now I will try somewhere else.
--------------------
Heather was my waitress and a bartender.
Everything I tried was fabulous.
I had tenderloin sliders with the french fries oh my.
God I will be going back here as often as I possibly can

You will not regret trying this place
--------------------
Honestly the food doesn't knock my socks off but other people seem to love this place. I go because my husband likes it as for me I'd rather go to a different BBQ spot. I guess it also depends on what you order.
--------------------
This place was so chill and relaxing. When I come back it'll definitely be in my list if stops. Not to mention the artist performing was fun and eclectic  (I mean really, a country version of "Let It Go", what's not to love?)
--------------------
It's was okay service was a bit on the interesting side as the person was new. Food presentation was good though they need to either add rice or more potato salad to the gumbo. Sprite was flat but I didn't need it anyways.
--------------------
Overpriced for what you get. I think this is a cute spot to meet up with a friend, but that's about it. I prefer my own homemade coffee to be honest. Adorable concept, just could use some improvement to products offered and prices.
--------------------
If you want shotty work and bad attitudes, this is the place for you. Mediocre for toes and poor for fingers. And don't try to make any suggestions or corrections without getting an attitude in returned and then talked about in another language.
--------------------
Really good, really authentic! This is some of the BEST Mexican cuisine I've tasted since my nana cooked for me; I'm from California so I would know. The enchiladas w/mole are awesome and the carne asada tacos remind me of Rosarito Beach, yummy!
--------------------
Updating previous trip- I still would take my kids there but the derma bond sucked. Poor buddy has a scar. Yea, yea...it's in a bad spot. And he's not quite two (read: squirmy.) 

I don't think it's too much to want it all. 

 :-/
--------------------
Excited to have this place in Reno! Delicious matcha and ube flavors! Like authentic. Friendly staff, looking to get better but what they have as a base is solid. Soft serve, cake and the sauces aren't overly sweet.  Hoping they add more flavors!
--------------------
This salon is filthy.  There are cobwebs and dust every where.  The equipment is old and in disrepair.  My nail technician was actually watching you tube videos while doing my nails!  I do not know how the health department hasn't shut them down.
--------------------
Went to see Anders Osborne play here & it was a highlight of my trip to NOLA.  Streetcar went straight down to Bourbon after the show but I wish I'd stayed longer! Food smelled awesome, drinks were very reasonably priced  & the crowd was mellow.
--------------------
This place is good. For the lofty prices the proportions were very small. However the drinks were cheap and the service was very good. The piano is a nice touch as well. 

The cheesecake is incredible, just get it and don't look back.
--------------------
I've only had the cannolis here but they are awesome! They're freshly filled when ordered and the filling is phenomenal. Not too sweet, it's perfect. If you like cannoli, if you don't think you like cannoli, you should definitely get one from Termini Bros.
--------------------
I had the pleasure to meet with Ann today and not only was she extremely helpful and so positive, she went above and beyond to make my 1st experience here amazing and made it a absolute regular customer from this day forward. Thanks girlie!!
--------------------
A menu that satisfies everyone's cravings! Clean, trendy, and delicious! I definitely recommend going early (before 9 am) as the wait tends to get longer after 9 am! But honestly, it is soooo worth the wait. You will leave there feeling so incredible satisfied!
--------------------
Worst place I've ever visited. The bouncer was rude and he didn't have to be. This place thinks just cause your on broadway you can treat people bad and over charge. 
 I'm not a tourist I live here and will never visit or recommend
--------------------
My husband had the 6 oz pepperloin meal and was very happy with it. I had the shrimp kabob meal. There were only 4 shrimp and they were more then well done and very small.  The service was good. The restaurant was not busy.
--------------------
Awesome food, great place to split a bunch of delicious spicy, ultra flavorful dishes with a large group. It's the Chinese restaurant a lot of people know about for good reason - I haven't had a single bad dish here, and it's always a crowd-pleaser.
--------------------
Don't go here. They gave me grief over the groupon then didn't bother to actually change my oil filter or tell me that they hadn't changed it so I drove 5k miles on an old filter. Crappy customer service, rude attitude, find somewhere better.
--------------------
A definite go-to place if you're in Treasure Island! Love the char-grilled oysters!  Great staff!  Big outdoor seating area and best yet, it's pet friendly so bring your pup!!!  Coming from Austin where pets are accepted everywhere this is a real bonus for me!
--------------------
Loved the abvionce.. got pampered and relaxed. It was hard to get a drink order place. Was the only reason I did not give them a 5. Had to ask 4 people before I was told to go call roommservice on the white phone.
--------------------
Melissa is by far the BEST! I've gone to two other lash lounges and I will tell you Melissa outdoes them all. She knows her craft. She doesn't double or triple stack lashes. She gets you in and out. 100% recommend going to Melissa.
--------------------
Very nice, quiet and dark restaurant. Chinese and sushi offered. Had szechuan chicken, hot and sour soup, and steamed rice. Hubbie had the prime rib and shrimp hot pot. Just the right amount of food. Didn't have to take any home. Service was excellent.
--------------------
Butch did a great job. The tour was relaxing, informative but 2 good stops to eat and see the cemetery. I recommend going on this trip the beginning of your stay so you know where to go during your trip. He'a also pretty fun.
--------------------
Beautiful modern place, they have a nice view, the only thing is that is close to the train and you may hear it if you are on that side of the building, other than that it's great and has a yolk on the corner!
--------------------
This place is just the best. If you really have to ask why it's all in the name itself. If u don't like chicken then don't come here bc their birds are fly! Don't forget to try their fried corn on the cobs. It's dank!
--------------------
Very impressed with this place! The food was amazing. Quick service chipotle style line ordering but with high-quality Indian food. Also the staff was super helpful in helping me decide what to get since I'm an Indian food newbie. Can't wait to eat there again!
--------------------
The catfish, chicken, gumbo and mac &a cheese are all to die for. We are the lunch buffet and everything was piping hot and fresh. This place was recommended by a local in the neighborhood we are staying in and it was so worth it!
--------------------
They have a couple of really nice ladies, that go out of their way to help you. But there's one that will rip your head off if you're not careful. It won't take ya long to figure this out on your own though.  Jus' sayin'......
--------------------
This place is disappointing for a 4.5 star rating. The burgers were so-so. The vibe felt very much like a chain restaurant like Red Robin. We did go on a Tuesday night so perhaps it's better on the weekends? Either way, we won't be back.
--------------------
Oh man! This is the spot right here! Everything is made to order and sooo worth the wait. I'm from Chicago and have been a self proclaimed sandwich expert for most of my life...this place deserves every bit of those 5 stars! Well done guys!
--------------------
Great variety of coffees and teas. My current favorite is the iced dirty chai. The staff is very nice and acknowledges your existence without making a person feel rushed. Table sizes for everyone! They also feature local artists art to purchase. I enjoy the vibe.
--------------------
I eat at Pina's or take-out about once a month. My favorites includes their dinner specials, cheesesteaks, calzones, and seafood dishes. The shrimp scampi appetizer (sans linguini) and steamed clams are excellent  inexpensive. Service is always flawless. For casual dining this place is very good.
--------------------
3.5 stars because they don't serve alcohol (and I was in dire need of a drink after a veryyyy long week). Get the margherita pie - it is delicious and fresh. Also ordered the Greek salad for an appetizer which was filled with yummy veggies. Yum.
--------------------
Freddy's has the best fast-food style burgers I've ever had. Great toppings choices and fresh meat. Their fries are delicious with their "fry" sauce. Their custard is just as good as their food. It's rich and creamy, and did I mention how delicious it is.
--------------------
The people at the store amazing! We came in to exchange a shirt from a few days before they had had some damage, and the managers were so helpful with our situation. Tonya is the best. Without hesitation she is going to help us out.
--------------------
The kayaking tour at the Santa Cruz Island was great.  My husband and I had a wonderful time.  Jen, our tour guide, was helpful and informative.  We had a lot of fun exploring the caves.  We didn't expect much but this tour definitely exceeded our expectation.
--------------------
I went to the pearl for my birthday and every detail of the experience was awesome!  The food, the wine and the service were all impeccable!  We didn't realize the time and were chatting away after closing time and the staff never made us feel rushed.
--------------------
Dr. Curtis Dechant has an excellent chair-side manner, and he establishes a good rapport with his patients. The office is very comfortable, and the latest high-tech equipment makes eye appointments much easier to bear. I also appreciate their selection of eyeglass frames and the friendly staff.
--------------------
I absolutely love EVAN he's the best guy ever. If he wasn't the door guy I don't know what people would do with themselves!!! He is one of the most awesome
People that I Know !!! If It wasn't for Evan I probably wouldn't come to OMALLZ
--------------------
I love Doan's. It's the kind of place you have a "usual" and every time you have it, it's just as good as the last time. They staff is friendly and speedy so if you don't have a long lunch it's a great place to go.
--------------------
Attended a party there. They now have a private room with your own bar and bathroom. I really enjoyed it. The buffet was good, didn't have to wait for a drink and you were able to hear each other talk. I would have a party there!
--------------------
Love the sweet spiral plain pies at Franzones.  Can't go wrong with plain.  I tried the white pizza with onions in addition and it was a pleasant surprise.  The onions were a great addition to the pizza.  Same Franzone's as the Bridgeport one I grew up with.
--------------------
This is the place for authentic Indian street food. I've been here multiple times ordering different things ranging from bhel puri, pav bhaji, vada pav, deconstructed samosa and aloo tikki, dabeli, kulfi and more. Everything was made exceptionally well.

I regret not having found this place sooner.
--------------------
Even after finding many great Spanish restaurants in the country (mostly NYC), Modesto is still one of my favorite Spanish place to eat.  This place is really good!  Too bad I don't live near St. Louis anymore since this is one of the places that I miss.
--------------------
Simply put .. Awesome . Surrounded by lakes , the apartment complex has very peaceful environment . The staff of the leasing office are very helpful and friendly. I had very nice experience staying here and would recommend the apartment to anyone who is looking for peaceful  stay in St. Petersburg,FL.
--------------------
The bouncers are awful, but I would be too if I were 4-feet tall and had an infinite amount of pent-up aggression and shielded childhood memories. 

This place stands for everything Reno shouldn't be. Choose LEX only if the sole alternative is being waterboarded during thanksgiving dinner.
--------------------
The cafe was extremely cute. We came at 8am and they even had a jazz band playing at that time. I got the breakfast sandwich and it was delicious. I loved how they rolled the egg and put the bacon pieces inside. Great price for a filling breakfast!
--------------------
Dine-in gets 2 stars. Disappointing service & venue falls short. 

The food was ok; so if you were to do take out, maybe this place would get 3 stars. 

I ordered the lamb kebab, which tasted ok; but it was very plain. No sauces, lettuce or anything - just meat.
--------------------
I got the gyro "platter" for lunch, which was dry, uninspired, and nothing like a deconstructed gyro. Worst of all, it came with "vegetables" which looked more like poop. Tasted that way, too. There are better places in Fairmount for lunch, and they won't serve you poop, either.
--------------------
A small aquarium that is interesting mainly for kids.  They have a shark feeding show and stingrays that you can pet and buy food to feed.  It is not the first place i would go in Tarpon Springa, but it is ok, small children seem to like it.
--------------------
Come here for delicious, home style New Orleans cuisine. We went in the afternoon, and although it was full, we were lucky and a table was ready right away. We did the a la carte as opposed to the buffet. It was our favorite meal of the trip!
--------------------
Worst experience ever!!!! 

I stood in line today for 1 hour and 20 minutes for 1 shot. They the walked up in front of me and closed the line. Told me they were done and leaving. There were 60 people behind me outraged as well. F*** this place
--------------------
The best fried rice ever! Also the best Pho I had while in Nashville. I'm from Seattle so I'm a little spoiled in that department. If you're looking for a good place to try it for the first time or just looking for a good Vietnamese restaurant, GO!
--------------------
Awesome! Loved this place. Great little breakfast joint easy walk south of route 90. Easy walk from French Quarter and surrounding areas. We got the bananas foster and it was incredible. Great decorations and colorful setting that feels like how you'd expect New Orleans to feel. Highly recommend.
--------------------
A great lunch or dinner stop in Reno, NV.  

We've had some fine meals in this establishment......Tyler (manager) does a great job with his staff, and it shows in the overall results.

They are also a pub, so its got a great selection of beers and wines too!
--------------------
The food was good, service was horrible. I ordered orange juice for my kids and waited till we were almost done eating then finally got the juices. They take cash or checks only. Everything else was OK, but they could do a little bit better on their service.
--------------------
Amazing place for lassi and chaat. The chaat is elegantly presented and tastes like traditional Karachi chaat. However, the chaat isn't as nearly as good as the lassi. It is soft and creamy and sweetened beautifully. Will be coming back for sure next time I'm in the area.
--------------------
This was a nice spot with sidewalk lounge seating. Even had a DJ outside Friday night. There was a walk up bar outside too. The decor inside was pretty sweet. We tried a few appetizers and they were both good! It is located in a trendy waterfront area.
--------------------
I've been to Lush in Arizona, S.F., San Jose and Maui. The one in New Orleans is My favorite one. I love how you can smell a Lush store from a block away. :) I've been to this one a few times, Always on Halloween. Always a fun time :)
--------------------
Always awesome!  Best crust ever and super Fresh ingredients and nice staff.  Lots of yummy toppings that aren't offered at other pizza places.   Great salads too! Patio area is a cool place to kick back,have a beer or glass of wine and savor the best pizza in town.
--------------------
I have purchased tires from Tires Plus in Flourtown at least 4 times. On this visit they mounted 4 new Michelins that I supplied. My car was worked on as soon as I arrived for the scheduled appointment at 9:00 and was returned to me within one hour.
--------------------
great hotel in a very good location. The staff was really friendly, and helped us out a lot. it's a 1-2 minute walk to the bars on Bourbon, 7-8 min walk to Harra's, 10 min walk to Jackson Square. The only downside is parking is $38 a night.
--------------------
We had a 2 1/2 day corporate conference here in the middle of June. The service was excellent, the facilities were very nice and I was fairly impressed with catering. Great spot for conferences or small conventions. Close to the airpor with a complimentary shuttle and complimentary parking.
--------------------
I had a most-delicious bagel sandwich this morning - pork roll, egg and cheese on an everything bagel. The price was very fair - $4.23 - and the bagels are made on site each day. They seem understaffed so hopefully they get some more staff to keep up with the crowds.
--------------------
The service was good and the staff was polite, but the food was bland and lacked flavor. The drinks were ok about what you would expect of a chain restaurant. If you are looking for somewhere to sit Down for a quick lunch this might be your place.
--------------------
Skip this train wreck if you are looking for dinner.  Our server was clueless...like we seriously thought she was lost in the restaurant.  Had to ask for setups, water refills, etc.  Ordered chicken parmesan and got eggplant parmesan instead with a fish bone in it.  The drinks were good.
--------------------
I can only comment on the vermicelli bowls because I have never had the Pho. 

The vermicelli are a decent size and a fair price. Conveniently located if you live in the Alberta Ave neighbourhood, my orders have always been ready in 15 minutes - even on a Friday night.
--------------------
We set up an online appt, meeting and transaction was very simple and painless. We opted for a 2hr side by side ride where we had a four-seater with our guide Matt (who by the way was super awesome and informative).  Throughly enjoyed our ride with some superb views.
--------------------
It's really a run of the middle as far as Cuban food goes. Not bad but not great either. I work close by so I end up there for lunch quite a bit. It's definitely worth checking out for lunch as their specials change every day and prepared freshly.
--------------------
Like wholefoods but much smaller. They have all sorts of stuff from Salad bar, to a small selection of fresh fruits, juice bar. Great lil grocery store. Couldn't really find any other in the city. They have a parking lot. Great walking, just a couple blocks from clothing stores
--------------------
We stopped in for brunch and we weren't expecting the food to be so delicious.  The 3 meat hash was amazing, as was the turkey sandwich and bagel/salmon.  The employees were very friendly and accommodating.  A little pricey, but well worth.  We will visit again if in the area.
--------------------
Hendricks is a must try in St.Louis. The meats,sauces,and sides are better than most barbecue places.Onion rings are huge and the coleslaw is tasty and finely shredded. Service is good and very friendly. Takes awhile to get the meal,but it gives you time to check out the unique decor.
--------------------
Tina I believe was our waitress.. I'm not sure if I want to give 3 or 4 stars. Its just that the initial wait was kinda long. But it was my first time eating the food and I thought it was pretty good. I liked my side salad too!
--------------------
I stopped at Walgreens in hopes of seeing the new ELF Villain's collection. Sometimes Walgreens gets them before the holidays. Sometimes they don't. This particular one doesn't ever get them according to their cosmetics person. SAD. Really sad. I suppose I'll have to skulk other Walgreens to find them.
--------------------
terrible food and the manager was shockingly rude when I tried to return my food. I had the frogs legs and they were rubbery and tasted awful. I was disgusted by her behavior and she should be ashamed of herself. I have never been treated more horribly by someone.
--------------------
Yummy food,  they will veganize things for you as well. The servers are friendly and the restaurant is spacious and has a bar and a stage area. We have had our work Holiday party here for the past couple years, both parties turned out great. The guacamole is awesome!
--------------------
I'm picky when it comes to pizza, and Brixx is a win every time! I love that their menu incorporates gluten-free options and perfectly sized lunch options. The wrap around bar also makes it the perfect stop to unwind after work, but arrive early, their patio fills up quickly!
--------------------
This place has went down hill to me. At first, when it was just the owner at the one store on linbergh, the food was amazing. It seems since he started branching out, the service and food has not been up to par. I think they lost my service.
--------------------
Really not sure what the hype was when it opened. It's fine, the ambiance was nice, but the menu is limited and food is nothing to write home about. They are in a nice location so at least if you decide to wait, then you have things to see...
--------------------
Not sure the significance behind the name and logo of the restaurant.  Unless it was three guys putting their money together to form this business 
The food was great/ staff friendly/ huge menu from breakfast /lunch/dinner to dessert.   Open 24 hours will definitely be back next time in town
--------------------
Calories and diabetes be damned - fewer things could be better than gelati on days as brutally hot as the ones we've had this week.  Thanks for helping to cool us all down w your frozen treats.  Five stars for you.

PS - visit the website for a little Vanilla Ice.
--------------------
Hands down great guys, we have relocated to the area and have older cars. With that age comes quirks, I great appreciate their honesty, hard work and communication of the situation at hand.  Attention to detail is never messed and I highly recommend this shop for any service needs.
--------------------
First time here and I'm not disappointed. Great seasoning on the seafood. I ordered oysters and their $45 combo and some garlic chicken wings for a family of six. It was more than enough for us. Only thing I can complain about is she messed up on our order.
--------------------
Highly, highly overrated.  The food was a C minus at best.  And the service was so bad that I may never go back.  They screwed up my order completely and my no apologies.  There are a lot of other options around State Street.  Avoid this place like the plague.
--------------------
Sometimes this food is very very good.  Unfortunately it's not consistent.   Ordered something I've been getting for years and every other time it tastes incredible. It's like they have different people in the kitchen and you don't know who you will get. So 50 % of the time it's excellent.  UGH.
--------------------
My friends at work (connoisseurs of good food in the St. Louis area) introduced me to yet another very nice restaurant and that's Brio's!! I like everything about it - starting from the complimentary bread and chips to the bruschetta, pasta and salads !! Beautiful place.. The service adds to the charm !!
--------------------
This was a cool place to stop by and check out the birds on a Sunday morning.  

My daughter and I have stopped in here a couple of times so she can look at the birds.  Very friendly staff.

If you're a bird person this is the place to go.
--------------------
Always excellent service and amazing food. The staff is is always friendly and there are many promotions that always keep us coming back. The quality of the fish is amazing and the perfect portion size of the rolls allows you to try many different kinds. Out favorite sushi in town!
--------------------
Love the food. Big portions, interesting and ever changing menue. The only issues i have are that the seating is cramped, too loud for conversation and the coffe is not as good as Sabrina's.

The latkas are always perfect and the bacon is the best I ahve had in Philly.
--------------------
Love!! Our new favorite local spot. We've gone a few times since they opened and it's always a good ambiance, and great food. The drinks are great, the salsa is super yummy, and the salads are very much entree sized. Bring your friends, sit outside, grab a margarita and enjoy!
--------------------
Dave was very nice and explained the menu, the dogs were whipped up fast and were delicious, hit the spot. Dave's special, pizza dog and a custom creation were all excellent and he threw in some grilled jalapeños too. Santa Barbara desperately needs more late night food carts like this.
--------------------
Literally, the worst Taco Bell I have ever been to. The restaurant is filthy, the service is awful, and they didn't make any of our order correctly, and really, how hard is that?  I won't be back and if I were you I would find a different place to go.
--------------------
Cool spot in a great location.
We got there early, so didn't have the same crushing crowds others have talked about.
The bartenders are awesome.
Made me a Perfect Rye Manhattan on the rocks, never had one before...I'm hooked.
Easily the best burger I've ever had!
Will absolutely be back
--------------------
Delicious top shelf pastries. I am outraged at the poor ratings. If you're looking for cheapness over flavor then go to Panera. Service has always been exceedingly pleasent when I go, and I am an obnoxious needy customer. We are so excited to have them make macaroons for our wedding.
--------------------
My friends and I all got one of each that were available to try out. I love the many fun donut flavors they have there. The thing that stood out to me was their fried chicken. I got the chicken sandwich and it was SO GOOD. I highly recommend it.
--------------------
In love with my haircut! Very reasonable prices as well. This is my second time here. The first time the cut and style were amazing but the color was a little off from what I wanted but it still looked good. I will definitely continue to be a returning customer.
--------------------
Joyce is awesome! Love that this does not hurt at all. We drive from palm harbor to her place, and it well worth the extra time. Her machine is high tech, and the horror stories my friends told me of their experience ,, makes me love this even more! Love it!
--------------------
Traveling through in our RV, stopped over in Granite City. Found this little gem of a cafe. Upon entering, the staff was very sweet and friendly. This is like home cooking. We ate here twice and all our food choices were fresh, delicious and like we would fix at home. Yum.
--------------------
The espresso here is excellent. My favorite place to come for an Americano. The staff is polite and friendly and vibes are mellow. It is important to know that there is no access to power outlets, but unlimited wifi access. The bathrooms and the rest of the establishment are always clean.
--------------------
The burgers were very good very flavorful. I had the El Mariachi. As with what other reviewers have said the portion is not big. But I believe it makes up in flavor. I also have salted caramel ice cream it was very good homemade style. I do recommend the rooster sauce.
--------------------
I grew up eating beef sandwiches in Chicago, and this place makes the best beef I've ever had outside of the city. 

Couple of suggestions: Offer a third sandwich size option (bigger!), get sweet peppers, serve fries(!!!), keep the main location off of Mass Ave open year-round, and have longer hours!
--------------------
Lots and lots of mostly fried seafood. Surprisingly expensive for a working class joint. It's the kind of place a dock worker would take his family for a fancy meal and not feel out of place. And it's definitely a New Orleans sort of experience. But the food isn't that great.
--------------------
I've eaten here numerous times and every time it's been absolutely fantastic. Great food, nice people, calm and quiet place. Their crepes are the best crepes I have ever had. Amazingly delicious. I recommend this place to my friends all the time. I've always heard great things from them as well.
--------------------
Went there for lunch and was pleasantly surprised, as having recently moved to Tampa from Los Angeles, I have been disappointed by the food.  However, I give Ploy Thai 4 stars, not just by Tampa standards, but by good food standards.  The food was very flavorful and the ingredients very fresh.
--------------------
Nice location and very friendly device. The restaurant feels like you could actually be dining in Ethiopian. The food however is probably a 6/10 based on several other Ethiopian restaurants we have eaten at. The lack flavor and taste. It's a reasonable restaurant for sure but again quite average - nothing special.
--------------------
Katie's is a neighborhood restaurant that has existed in one form or another for a few generation.  It's classic New Orleans fare with an Italian-American slant.  Great meatballs.  You'll see all types of classic New Orleans old people dinging before 8pm.   You won't be disappointed if your expectations aren't too high.
--------------------
The TV shows are $4.99 and they have commercials! What a cheesy way to make money and a sign of a less than classy hotel, particularly when you pay more than $150 a night.  And there is NO complimentary breakfast, just an overpriced buffet, something even the cheapest hotels in California provide.
--------------------
I am a huge fan of Gennaro's. It's got a thin crust, sweet and rich tomato sauce along w fresh mozzarella cheese. Also, the meatballs are excellent. Can't say enough about how much I love it here. Also, the decor is vintage and adorable. 

I have yet to be disappointed with Gennaro's
--------------------
Great atmosphere, service was very friendly and prices were very reasonable however I found the food a bit bland, not bad just bland. My husband and I were starving after a long drive to Philly and this filled the spot but it wasn't overly enjoyable and we most likely won't be back.
--------------------
I am not an indian food type of person but this place lives up to the hype. When you go, just let Hassan make something for you, don't try and overwhelm yourself with the different options. Make sure to get a chaat and a lassi as the two really complement one another.
--------------------
I love Italian food and with this being so close to home, I gave it a shot. Not only did they exceed my expectations in food quality and quantity, but every time we order pick up, or dine in the girls treat us amazing (You rock Alexa!) Thank you for being awesome.
--------------------
This is our go-to takeout place. It has great food and exceptionally fast service. I live at 2601 Parkway and they deliver right to the door of my condo which many delivery places don't do. Their staff is friendly, make great pizza, and generally run such a business as best you can.
--------------------
Rude staff. Can't even get a salad order right. Overpriced by the slice. When we sat down to wait for our food I thought wow this is taking a long time given the fact we were the only people in there. I guess it should stay that way. Don't waste your money.
--------------------
Went on a Monday to have a daiquiri and watch a little bit of the NBA basketball game.  Asked the young lady working if she would be willing to turn on the game and was told she was watching Netflix.  I guess customer service is not important anymore.  Won't ever go back.
--------------------
Not impressed at all. Sandwich bar was closed so I ordered a burrito. It was reheated in the microwave, cost 8 bucks, and nasty. Some sort of cream of chicken and old cheese on top. I'm amazed they can sell this and call it food. Could have had better at taco bell.
--------------------
First visit tonight. Nice, clean place. Reasonably priced. Friendly staff. Excellent presentation of extremely bland, mediocre food. I ordered the chicken fajitas. Onions and pepper base (warm) on a tepid fajita platter. Meat, room temperature. Pico, cheese, sour cream, tortillas were nothing special. I was underwhelmed. I don't think I'll be back.
--------------------
I am a groupie. He is amazing. I am sad that I got to have his dish only once. Now all construction on market I can't find him!!

His chicken is the most tender and smoky I've ever had. Side dishes are creative and awesome too. 
I hope he is back soon.
--------------------
After always shopping at the Randall's off Jefferson, it was nice to see West County get their own Randall's. Staff here is uber friendly and helpful. Beer selection is solid here, with plenty of styles to choose from.Prices are competitive with the other beer markets around. Well worth your time and money.
--------------------
The loose tea can get expensive, 
but I love getting ready made teas, pretty wide selection, always something new and they let you mix to make your own concoction, always comes out perfect!
The staff are the nicest people around. They remember me when I come in and remember what I like :-)
--------------------
Man. This place is nice. The bartender was awesome. Try the burger. It's fresh with all local ingredients. The plates of food I saw come out looked amazing as well. 

The beer is cold. The drinks are mixed perfectly.  This is not a chain restaurant but a dedicated local place with good employees.
--------------------
Buckingham Pizza makes the best pizza around, particularly its plain pizza and a few of its specialities -- try the cool ranch pizza. This is a pizza parlor. Don't get fancy....order the pizzas and maybe some sides. While some of the entrees are good (chicken piccata), stay with the pizza and you'll love it.
--------------------
This place is game changer for the neighborhood. We got some take out tonight and the food was absolutely  delicious.  I'm really stoked they moved in and I'm newly smitted by southern Latin food.  The family who owns it also seem very sweet! 
I think this place is exactly  what the neighborhood needed!
--------------------
I've always had good experiences here. The food is creative and tasty and the house wines are decent. Their cocktails are well made but small. I've never had a problem with service but also haven't been here during a super busy time. The patio is a great spot to hang out with friends.
--------------------
Came with the family based on a recommendation and was not disappointed.  I consider myself to be a bit of a Pizza connoisseur and this was right up there.  The staff was friendly and the food came out quick.  Solid experience across the board.  I would come back and recommend it to others.
--------------------
Good Chinese food and really nice beer selection.  Haven't tried the sushi yet, so I can't speak to that.  True, the staff isn't exactly the most cordial, but they're plenty nice enough for Chinese food take out.  This is not an expensive or fancy restaurant, so you should go in with reasonable expectations.
--------------------
Awesome location, good service is why I have been eating there for the past 15 years off and on. Mostly the excuses about the steak is why I have to write the review. I am happy to pay more for good quality steak but don't blame the poor guy that sold it to you !
--------------------
Fast.  Fresh.  The carne was very good.  So was the guacamole.  Wish there was the ability to customize taco toppings.  The tortilla chips were too thick.  The dulche de leche  soft serve ice cream was amazingly delicious.  Wish that there was more seating.  Wish that table clean ups were more timely and more thorough.
--------------------
I like the Neuvo-Latino-Americano grub here.  The place has moved locations and is now a bit larger.  Chips & Salsa are always fresh 7 tasty, too.

I wish I could give a more substanital review but I ate here so long ago - and at the old location - so I'd better just keep my mouth shut.
--------------------
I love Mr. Wizard's because they offer frozen yogurt which is a  lot healthier than frozen custard. I like that they offer some pre-select combinations or you can create your own. The only part that sucks is that there is only outside seating so if it's cold outside, plan to eat in your car.
--------------------
Eh, crust was dry and we got the Delmar which instead of pizza sauce they use bbq sauce however they barely put any on the pizza which caused it to be dry. The server was good. The pizza took forrrevvverrr to come out though we had been done with our salads for 20-30 minutes.
--------------------
If you beat the crowd you're in. Small but that's the only negative. Everything I've tried on the menu is AMAZING! They even have vegetarian/vegan items. I always get whatever french toast special they have. I always take people who stay with me for Mardi Gras here for breakfast before we hit the parades.
--------------------
Family diner. Had the buffet. Eclectic assortment: a large chicken leg, fried jalapeño, tamale, two rolled grape leaves, fresh melon. All good. Lots of Mexican choices there. Also has a menu with breakfast served all day long. Friendly, attentive staff. Good place for a casual relaxed meal with no expectations. Next to the Clarion Hotel.
--------------------
Been here so many times before and all I can say is the food is really good. A hidden gem in Florissant, it has the best Panang curry around. Haven't been to their sister restaurant yet, but I can't seem to want to move on when I am always so satisfied with their fare here.
--------------------
Don't know what it is but If my tummy's feeling icky, I can count on Chipotle's stake to fix me up. I just have to remember not to go during full on lunch time. I usually go between 2 & 4 when it's peaceful and calm. Busy or not the service is always friendly and fast!
--------------------
Paid for non-smoking room but there was a smell and ashtrays in the room. Since all we were doing was sleeping there we didn't say anything. Shower was crazy slow to drain. Pillows were so lumpy that I woke up with a migraine. Room was clean and staff was nice. Free wifi but wouldn't connect.
--------------------
I've been to this place in numerous occasions and I have never been disappointed! My friend and I are traveling to Puerto Rico and my mother in law wanted Tamales! They were very accommodating and gave us free samples and offer to cook them and pack them for us! Great place and very friendly staff!
--------------------
Wow. We visited NOLA last week and took the truly awesome and informative  Steamboat Natchez trip on March 30. Can't tell you how interesting it was and pleasant. Plus these people are so well-organized and nice. JoJo reserved us a window seat - just could not believe the kind and excellent service. 
Very very nice.  Recommend!!!!
--------------------
Best casino in Reno.   4 deck and 2 deck blackjack, real drink glasses (no plastic fratboy cups), amazing decorum that will burn your retinas, and the restaurants inside are better the big casinos on the strip by a factor of a thousand.
The rooms are stellar for the price.  Get a hot tub and chilllllll.
--------------------
Beers were amazing! I got the porter, the double IPA and the table gutt and they were all fantastic. Food was also killer if you like Russian cuisine. They had a special when I went with a sausage and sauerkraut which was tasty. I also got the pickled everything appetizer, great choice. This place rules.
--------------------
Seriously one of the most pleasant dining experiences I have had in a while. Smiley himself is a true gem and the food was DELICIOUS. Had so much that I am eating it for lunch again today - and I can't wait! Please recommend to everyone you know in Manayunk, don't want to lose this place!
--------------------
My dad and I are on a cross country trip and one of our first stops was Saguaro National Park. 
We did a quick tour with Park Ranger Carolyn and loved it. She was incredibly enthusiastic and passionate about her studies on the saguaro and she was very knowledgeable. Definitely recommend both the tour and Carolyn.
--------------------
Went here for dinner on opening day and was SO HAPPY I DID!! Great atmosphere, lovely staff, and food on fleek!! Green tea (PHO PHREE) was so satisfying, summer rolls and spicy peanut sauce were DELISH, and pho was PHONOMENAL! Definitely making this one of my regular hot spotz as I eat my way through Fairmount!
--------------------
Don't let the shopping center location deter you! Amazing place and even a more amazing staff. Curtis is the true epitome of great service. Loves his job and wants nothing more than for you to enjoy your dining experience. Try the scallops small plate, you won't regret it, but the whole dining experience is top notch.
--------------------
Our office went today for Friday's happy hour special.  Such a great deal, and it wasn't packed.  Didn't expect it, but the food and drinks on their specials-amazing!  Usually the happy hour offerings wouldn't be. Definitely try the pork sliders and the beignets for dessert.  Really fun time and great atmosphere.

Staff was very friendly too!
--------------------
Great professional tat shop!! My husband and I are very happy with our new ink. Bryan did an outstanding job and I highly recommend him. All the employees were super nice and I can see why this is the city's #1 tattoo shop. Don't forget their new location is 1418 N. Clairborne, in Suite 5, upstairs.
--------------------
This place was nice, clean, and bright. It's your typical serve-yourself fro yo bar with several choices for frozen yogurt and a topping station. The cashier was very (berry?) nice and let me pay via credit card even though I was a few cents short of the minimum. I'd say my son enjoyed his time here.
--------------------
Peppermill has done it again with service and accommodations that are second to none.  Gaming at the mill (i only play 1 dollar or 25 cent slots) seems to provide better outcomes and I know reno. Spent a lot here and found the peppermill is the best. Food is some of the best and reasonably priced.
--------------------
Deseree has done my hair for over a decade and I wouldn't trust anyone else. From blonde to brunette, to long or short, she does it all. She's styling my hair for my upcoming wedding plus 6 bridesmaids and I have no doubt it'll be picture perfect. Deseree is accommodating, dependable,and experienced (oh, and hilarious too )!!
--------------------
Just recently ate here for the first time. The hype was real. My girlfriend had the Greek Salad while I ordered the Chickpea Vegetarian Pita and they were kind enough to allow for some substitutions. The food was on point and portions were very filling and satisfying. Great staff and environment. Will definitely be back again!
--------------------
I'm so incredibly happy with our pictures! Angela Clifton Photography have worked with us 3 times and we have been happy with every single picture that was taken! Not only are the photos fabulous, but we had such a fun experience. The price is extremely reasonable and the pictures will be a keepsake we will cherish forever!
--------------------
The court house is very old and the art is great. The spiral staircase is funny. One can get view of entire city from 5th level. The tower clock room is really surprising with all mechanical gears inside!! You need a prior appointment to get into clock room. Worth spending 2 to 3 hours of time here.
--------------------
This place was so yummy and decently priced. I felt that the escargot would have been better as traditional escargot but the playing was nice. You can dine with the ghost (former owner of the mansion who killed himself on their 2nd floor) for an additional $50. The table is by itself in a cold dungeony room.
--------------------
I didn't really like my sandwich I got here. I got the jalapeño cheese bread and it was tasteless and dry. I could tell it was old. Also I got tomatoes and cucumbers which were mush because they were overripe. Usually they're a lot better than this but today wasn't it. The staff is very friendly though.
--------------------
In Reno for the night. Was a bit skeptical because well..it's Reno, but this place far exceeded expectations. Very good Taiwanese food compared to most places I've tried in different cities. My recommendations: 三杯鸡, oyster omlet, and scallion pancake. 

There are many other dishes I wish I could try. Will definitely miss this place once I leave.
--------------------
I loved this place!  We drove down from Tahoe just to eat here!  The 90 miles round trip was worth it!  The food was that good!  The Chicken Basil was the best!  And they have good Boba Tea!

Don't believe the nay-sayer about this place.  The food was pretty authentic Taiwanese.  Try it and see for yourself!
--------------------
Pros:

-Superb cheeseburger - thick, evenly cooked, (almost) medium rare, nice sauce, soft bun
-Tasty (complimentary) zucchini bread
-Good service
-Good G+T selection
-Cool ambience
-Downstairs from my apartment

Cons:

-Expensive
-Per wife, the waitress "seemed disappointed" that we only ordered cheeseburgers (this was not verified, status as a "con" is under review)

Looking forward to going back.
--------------------
Food was excellent but when asked to honor their yelp offer of 10% off our bill for checking in and reviewing their business, We were told that they would not honor the deal until our next visit even though the yelp countdown said we had 4 hours to redeem the deal. Great food, but bad business practice :(
--------------------
This was hands down the best tuna melt I have ever had. Very clean! This was also the best service I have ever had at a cafe. Awesome service and really on top of things. It's crazy because it is inside the grocery store! They should expand this cafe without the store attached!!! It would be amazing!!
--------------------
This is a great place to bring the kids to. They can have juice, a slice of cake, and homemade popsicles. They think it is a tea party. I have tried everything once and my favorites are the homemade doughnuts filled with read bean, the popsicles, the patbingsu, and even the good ol' coffee cream and sugar.
--------------------
We had a great experience enjoying happy hour here! Vaughn and Mark are so kind, we will absolutely be back to get that same service. It's truly one of a kind. The free appetizer was awesome and the slot machines at the bar brought us luck. What a fun happy hour with amazing service!! It's a must!
--------------------
First, I love that they offer food delivery! Second, THAT is a gyro! I got one delivered with fries, and actually I didn't need the fries! The gyro was so big I had to save half.  Both the fries and the gyro were very tasty. The tzaziki was spot on and the meat tender. I'll be back!
--------------------
This place is awesome the food is dynamite . Super friendly service. And the. Coup de grace was the flan made in house fresh and believe me I've tried flan everywhere, there's is exceptional. The price was right on point. My only suggestion to make this place go into the stratosphere is if they had a liquor license.
--------------------
I was very pleased with my experience here!  Good, fast service--you can linger after your meal because you've paid up front. 

And, most importantly the food is fresh and tasty!  I loved my chicken taco salad and the plantains we got.  The drinks, especially the mojito, were good too. 

Will definitely be back to try more things.
--------------------
Neat diner, unlike other diners as it's quaint and has a good feel to it. I had the Yankee pot roast....which was ok....mashed potatoes were just ok and the meat was kind of bland. The veggies were excellent, fresh, not out of a can.  My wife had an omelette which she said was good. Service was excellent.
--------------------
First time checking it out first breakfast as recommended by a friend! Service was quick and friendly. It was a busy Saturday morning but we got seated right away. I loved the veggie omelette with fruit and rye toast. Overall good selection to fit anyone's tastes. Reasonable prices for the amount of food. Will be back again!
--------------------
Needs some attention in the dining room. Good salad  but skimpy on the bread. No sweet tea .  I noticed a booth with children almost be for at least 30 minutes. One was a sleep. Finally an employee came out to them. She must have brought to work with her. I was concerned because they were small & alone.
--------------------
Chicken was salty, I ordered 1/2 chicken, rice and plantains to go for lunch. With the chicken and rice, I only received 2 pieces of plantains & paid I've $8 for this meal. Totally not worth it. There were great reviews but it was not my day. I will have to think twice before ordering from here again.
--------------------
Yes, this is the only sushi place in town. However, it is great when you're craving sushi and don't have time to go somewhere else. The salmon is probably the best fish they have, so we always order salmon. We also love their spicy edamame, tempura, ocean salad, and cabbage salad. Service has always been friendly and quick!
--------------------
Say you decide that you need a new door...and you only have $35.  Where do you go?  the Green Project. 

Or you have a bunch of left over building supplies, random bits of lumber, some roofing materials, maybe even some paint?  Where can you bring it so it doesn't end up in a landfill?  Again, the Green Project.
--------------------
I LOVE this place!  I have been coming here for a few years now.  Its a little funky, and I would never order say the escargot, for safety reasons, but when it comes to lots of Saki, great rolls, and mountains of rice and Sashimi, this is the way to go.  Young atmosphere, loud dance music, and SAKI!
--------------------
Tried the pulled pork, green beans, Mac n cheese and cornbread. It was all pretty mediocre barbecue. Not bad, not great. The pork was a little overdone/dry, but had a nice smoky flavor. The original bbq sauce is pretty sweet/syrupy. Ill probably go back, but I wouldn't if there was a better option as close to my house.
--------------------
Again for those that see my review I only give 5 stars after multiple trips.   This local pho shop has an eclectic regular clientele that is loyal for a reason.   Great food and very nice staff. 

The ingredients are so fresh.   I had bun beef because I was not phongry. That is pho hungry.   

Highly recommend stopping in.
--------------------
First time I went to Earl's new American kitchen I liked the food it was good wasn't great but it was a ok 
 service not so great sat at the bar did not really care for a bartender tried it again second time bartender was really rude I would never go back there  or Recommend it to anyone
--------------------
I will not return to this location. I contacted the manager in regards to a poorly made pizza I received, he replied to my online inquiry but never followed through on taking care of things. I even sent a photo to prove that the appearance of the pizza was not acceptable, and I never heard back from him.
--------------------
I definitely preferred the pizza from nabruzzi, but Enzo's is still a good take out option in the area. I recommend their meatball sub and garlic knots. The meatballs taste homemade and of good quality. We'll continue to get food from here, but I do wish they would still offer the pizzas they had when it was nabruzzi
--------------------
This place is amazing!!! There aren't enough words for how amazing the food is here. The BBQ shrimp are a must and if you're into truffle oil/butter flavors I highly recommend the truffle fries (more than enough to share) and the truffle butter filet mignon. For dessert the bread pudding and white chocolate brownie are both good options!
--------------------
I've been going to Mark for at least 2 years now. I've gone to salons like Dominic Michael etc and am used to paying $35 plus tip for a cut. I learned about Blades and since I knew the owner had salon experience felt comfortable trying him. Mark is a great guy and I always love my cut.
--------------------
Steve our Roto-Rooter tech saved us!! Thanks to Steve! We just moved into a new house and had sewer back-up a week later. It was coming out into the yard and not pretty. We are running free now and hopefully won't need to call back any time soon. If we do we will certainly call Roto- rooter again!!!
--------------------
This is our "go to" place! The food is consistently good and we always have friendly attentive waiters to sometimes help with our decisions. One of our favorites is the pasta pockets with pear filling. Really delicious! It's also byob which is always a plus. This is a great restaurant with a real cozy, family atmosphere. Highly recommend.
--------------------
Food and coffee are great. Just have 30
Minutes to stand in line and wait for the ONE cashier to make change. Either they fix this and add another cashier or they will be dead. Shouldn't have to wait for one cashier while 5 other folks stand behind the one cashier watching the line grow. Adds other till!
--------------------
This may look like just a hole in the wall food establishment but if you judge on that alone, you'd be missing out. The food here is fantastic from the way it's prepared to the seasoning they use. Amazing gyros, fish and chicken in a variety of ways. Whatever you do, please try some dessert when you go.
--------------------
Service and management terrible... After messing up all 4 of our orders the waiter got mad and started cursing... The manager offered our drinks to be free.. What a mess. The food was cold and nasty didn't even eat half of it and waited over an hour... I will never dine in any cracker barrel again after this experience...
--------------------
I took the beginning class there, and I loved it. It was perfectly paced, and though the moves weren't difficult, they really stretched me in places I didn't know existed! I even broke a small sweat! But I felt great afterwards! The studio is clean, and I like that I can buy some Beyond Organic food items there too.
--------------------
This is a pretty good pancake place, but it's a little disorganized in the way it's run when it's really busy. The pancakes are pretty good but super sweet, so you have to be in there. Good price point. Serves breakfast all day so that's definitely a plus, but not anything particularly special that you couldn't get anywhere else.
--------------------
Picked up takeout from Village Whiskey (so I can't review the actual restaurant). The Whiskey Burger is pricy ($26) but is amazing if you're ok with a greasier burger. Super tender, the bacon is awesome and it's pretty big. If you can get past the price then highly recommend it. The Duck Fat fries are also rich and delicious.
--------------------
Excellent.  Went there for lunch (the budget option).  Prix fixe menu was tempting.  Wife had the prime rib po'boy with the soup of the day (tomato fennel).  Both were excellent (the po'boy being an upscale interpretation, with gruyere and a really good horseradish sauce).  I had the seafood jamabalaya and seafood gumbo, also excellent (probably the best I've had).
--------------------
Real Thai food and they'll make it spicy if you ask for it pet pet. I really like both their soups. The curries have excellent flavor but they can seem runny if you're not used to Thai curries. I'm not super thrilled with the eggrolls but my girlfriend always gets the veggie ones. Perhaps the meat ones are better.
--------------------
I actually eat here at least once a month . The food is good and the service compliments it. You will fall in love with there zucchini muffins. I always leave with some stashed in my purse, you know for later. The prices are cheap and they have a fantastic frozen yogurt bar . with unlimited toppings. Have fun !! yum yum
--------------------
I love this shoppe. I have been here a few times, but I have been coming more regularly. The staff is AWESOME and the atmosphere GREAT. THey have healthy tasty treats which is nice and a host of croissants and other tasty treats. They also have food for lunch and breakfast. I havent had anything here that wasnt fantabulous.
--------------------
Got a gift certificate to this place over 6 months ago and just last month FINALLY had the GREAT  pleasure of going!! Perfect  spot for lunch. I'm in love with the mixed salad salad sandwich!! One sandwich that I will actually crave:-) yummy homemade ice cream that you won't be able to get enough of!  We will be back.
--------------------
I used to go here all the time for the lunch special, and it was a great deal. We've been only a few times in the last year because my husband isn't a fan, but I enjoy it. The prices do seem to have gone up a fair bit in recent times, but it's still never a disappointing meal.
--------------------
Ordered some food at 11:47pm after not eating all day due to airline issues. I was starving. 2 and 1/2 hours later my food was delivered after I called twice looking for it.  When it arrived, there was no utensils or napkins.  I ate my salad with my fingers.  The food is good, the service is horrible.  Never again!
--------------------
Despina is the waxing godsend of EWC! she is quick and friendly! You leave there feeling so fresh, their wax is FAR better than the strip junk. Despina is very professional and listens. 
she has made my eyebrows on fleeeek. Who would ever think you would enjoy waxing appointments???! I do thanks to Despina!! The best in the biz.
--------------------
Amazing and comfortable atmosphere with extremely unique flavor combinations in the dishes. The Cuban Lamb Frita is a must (add the egg! It's worth it). All of the side items are delicious, you literally can't go wrong. The staff is friendly and they are extremely efficient with the coffee refills. This has quickly become my new regular brunch spot!
--------------------
Went in for full set, request long showed picture. Nails were cut short no big deal, the issue came when I pointed out a crooked nail and was told it hadn't been filed, acrylic was put on nail still crooked. It was filed and getting shorter and shorter. This wasn't my first visit however it will be my last.
--------------------
I tend to stay away from strip mall bars, that being said my buddy John is a bar back here and raved about it so we decided to give it a try. The food is very good, I will try their pizza next time, they also have a killer craft bar they just added, prices are very reasonable too
--------------------
We visited once and were very disappointed in my veggie pizza and my husband's sub sandwich.  The tomato sauce was not tasty, and they did not use enough cheese on my pizza.  The dough looked and tasted like it was prepared by a machine.  Perhaps they have improved, but we are not in any rush to try a second time.
--------------------
We've been coming here since I was a kid. The staff has watched me and now my kids grow up. They're personable and so nice. They're also very prompt with service. Yoli and frank are the absolute best! The food is amazing! I absolutely love their shredded beef burro and cheese crisp. I feel they have true authentic Mexican food.
--------------------
Just had a late dinner there on a Sunday night and was really surprised at how good the sushi was and how low my ticket was. I had a plate full of sushi and it cost me $13.00. The staff seems to be having a good time too. Very friendly place. I really enjoyed it and will be back soon!
--------------------
This might be my favorite coffee shop in the city. The food is unbelievable. Anything I have ordered has been fresh, delicious and so enjoyable. The place has a cool edgy vibe and lots of comfy seating and some great seats outside when the weather is nice. Definitely worth checking out especially if you want a some food as well.
--------------------
The worker was awesome; this is a review for the company.  The price paid isn't in alignment to the service provided, it is just expensive. The worker is still paid hourly, which motivates him/her to work the hours. I believe it is a better way to hire someone off craigslist and pay them to do a service, rather than hourly.
--------------------
You must stop here while in NOLA.  It's a small place, but you feel like you just stepped into a bar during prohibition. While we were there, there was an amazing Jazz band. There is also a small room off to the side where you can sit on a coach and sip your cocktail.

The Vieux Carre was excellent here!
--------------------
Frank is a great dentist and a very nice guy. He has a gentle manner, takes a sincere interest in his patients and in general is a top quality dentist and person. If you are in the market for a dentist he is an excellent choice. I've gone to him for years and know many others who have as well.
--------------------
Great grocery store in the Mid-city neighborhood. It had great deli, soup, hot bar, and salad bar options. It was like a waaaay less expensive Whole Foods. On the weekends they had crawfish or lobster boils by the lbs. This would be my go to store if I lived here for sure. Big plus it's LOCAL!!!

* Fried Chicken was BOMBlicious!!!!
--------------------
Great place for happy hour. Oysters were deLISH! My friend and I had 2 dozen and we had some cocktails! The riverbend and champagne au poir we quite tasty. I had a side of fries and she had a side a grits. Best grits I've eaten. Definitely coming back. The server was great too. Just the right amount of attention!
--------------------
Really good burger. I had the Bourbon Black and Bleu. It was cooked like I wanted and very tasty. 

I gave them 3 stars for the wait. We had a big party - 4 adults and 5 kids - and it took over an hour to get our food. Shouldn't have taken that long, regardless of how many people were at our table.
--------------------
Very good sushi. The peanut avocado roll is a must try. Delicious! I ordered the Volcano roll as well and it was amazing. The service was also great, very friendly customer service. I will definitely visit again even though it's far from where I live. If you find yourself near Valrico, then definitely visit this restaurant. You will not regret it.

OMG! What an amazing dinner experience. A friend recommended this place and it was incredible. We had two of their signature dishes -- the BBQ shrimp and bread pudding. This is a fantastic restaurant with great ambience and fantastic service. Highly recommend it if you're visiting New Orleans. Their fried green tomato appetizer was a great way to kick off the meal.
--------------------
This use to be a reliable place for sandwiches but the last two were not good at all.  Cheesesteak was light on the meat.  There are so many good rolls to pick from in the Philly area but this roll was one of the worst and stale.

Hopefully it was just an off night. I'll try again but not for awhile.
--------------------
I guess the ingredients weren't as fresh today since my boyfriend threw up twice upon eating chili beef nachos.  We had a to-go order - I got a chicken burrito.  It gave me some stomach cramps and other issues.  Just a heads up.

However, we keep coming back since I love your shredded beef.  I thought I would change it up today.
--------------------
Worst nail salon experience ever. The guy said "what is wrong with you" to a customer who accidentally chipped her nail. When I was explaining how I wanted my nails filed he told me to do it myself. Really bad job. Everyone was rude and does the job too quickly. You would think after having such bad reviews they would learn..
--------------------
Corropolese is a staples in these parts. If you're looking to get tomato pie, it's sacrilege to go anywhere else for it! Now I will admit, they do offer a variety of other items, but I couldn't tell you what they are. Whenever an event calls for a tomato pie, this is where my family goes. No one does it better!
--------------------
I went back here and either I didn't remember the prices  (because someone else had paid last time) or their prices had gone up. It was almost $20 for 2 basic sushi rolls!! While the portions are big, they aren't filling enough to justify such a high price for 2 rolls for lunch. Will not be coming back at those prices.
--------------------
It was great. The your was interesting if you're in to tours. The beer was good. The atmosphere was the best part. A couple of Tvs for sports, board games, live music, and yours every hours. At times it seems like there's a lot going on but it flowed well. Great spot for a good time with friends or a date.
--------------------
Good food, reasonably priced, and nice staff. Not ideal for eating in, but since they are going for a fast food approach to vegan food, that makes a lot of sense. I know the buffalo bella is the dish that they push the hardest, but for my money the Cheesesteak is the way to go. And pro-tip: Get the sweet potato fries.
--------------------
Maybe caught the staff on a bad day, but the people in the pharmacy were not friendly. Was told my prescription be ready in 15, when i showed up 20 minutes later they said it would be ready in a half hour. If your in a hurry dont bother filling up your prescription here. Might as well go next door to Walmart!
--------------------
THE BEST place to go for gyros! The quality of their food is amazing. I always get chicken gyros here but they have all kinds of goodies. My daughter loves their burgers. And the thick, perfectly seasoned steak fries are the bomb! Always hot and fresh. 

The only thing I did not care for was the baklava. They make it with pistacios.
--------------------
This hospital is by far the best for families on the East Coast. They make seeing multiple MDs on the same day very easy and the quality of care is incredible. The renovated wing is fantastic with good accommodations for caregivers and friendly and attentive staff. I wholeheartedly recommend A.I. DuPont and will continue to travel from NY for my child's care.
--------------------
Pulled pork sandwich was Delicious .. BUT! The lucky bun (Asian fusion style ) burger . Was a disappointment for the sole purpose of them using a frozen beef patty :/  the bread was good .. The toppings and sauces were great .. But just killed the flavors with a processed frozen beef patty .. If used a fresh ground meat .. It would have been a great gourmet burger ..
--------------------
Great ambiance!  Loved the trendy and modern decor.  The presentation of the dishes was also great.  The food was just okay though.  The potatoes weren't cooked and the pancakes were a bit on the greasy side.  Would def. go back again and give it another try...french toast and omelette looked good!  I would also like to try their lunch. Service was excellent.
--------------------
The Paris Hair Salon is a warm, friendly inviting personal experience with people who really know hair. I have thick unruly hair and many don't take the time to carefully go through it. Paris Hair takes the time and makes it right, I am so pleased, and the price is right too. Cut, color and hilites all perfect, every time! -Maureen Kerfoot
--------------------
Venus nail is great. I was looking for a new salon and googled some in my area. I've been 3 times now and they've been amazing. Great atmosphere and service. Ask for Ivy she's fantastic. I told her I was going on a trip for my bday and to come up with something. I walked out with this and loved it all.
--------------------
In a word... "OVERRATED!".  The food took forever to come out.  The burger was WAY overcooked (Especially when I ordered it Medium Rare) and the Seafood Jumbalaya was Decent.  Not worth the price.  There are better places to eat in the french quarter.  It was not horrible, but for everything that we had heard about this place, I would have expected much better.
--------------------
My brother came to visit and we wanted to pick up a six pack of good beers for a night in. Ended up staying and having a few while playing their Nintendo 64 (Super Smash Brothers, which the owner said was donated by fellow patrons). It's a great place with good food and genuinely nice people. Should be a staple in the Northeast.
--------------------
Men's clubs is the tits, plain and simple. All the barbers got skills enough to hook it up fresh. Been coming here for 3 years and I've never had any problems. Except for maybe that one time when this dude tried to steal my cut. Tim kept it real though and said "I can't give you the same cut as Ryan." Thanks Tim.
--------------------
Absolutely wonderful food & service! Go there for lunch/dinner with my boyfriend at least once every two weeks. Prices are very much reasonable. Weekends get pretty packed so may have to wait a little bit but that's never an issue for us. Always get the Indian Pancake & the Hainanese Chicken or Curry Chicken. Other dishes are delicious as well. Never get tired of it!
--------------------
I really like Franzone's. The owner is typically around, super friendly, and seems to really care about the product. While I'm not a big fan of sweet sauce, they also do a decent cheesesteak, fries, etc. Honestly, they may have been closer to a 4 if not that it's always just a really pleasant experience going in, which boosts their rating for me.
--------------------
Great job on my fill and gel pedicure. Even though it was close to closing, they took their time and even accommodated every request I had (I'm VERY particular). Clean environment and very friendly staff. Way more than I could have expected for a nail salon in a mall. P.S. My foot and hand massages afterwards were heavenly. I will DEFINITELY be back!!!
--------------------
Decent frozen yogurt with a lot of options for toppings. They have about 8 different froyo flavors to chose from. Lots of possible combinations. However, it can get expensive pretty quickly when you weigh the cup. 

There's not a lot of seating inside. Staff is friendly but not very active. I do want to try their bubble tea, but j wasn't very impressed.
--------------------
My business, my parents, my ex-husband, my son and myself have accounts with this credit union. We have been with them for about 4 years and have been quite satisfied. With this many accounts and this many people there have been some errors however we go directly to the branch to have them corrected. So far that has worked out great for us.
--------------------
I went in when they had 4 people working, waited for 15 minutes for my tea latte which came out as basically water. Returned it twice but gave up when the barista offered some other iced tea latte they already had instead. It was still the same - water. The baristas should REALLY REALLY learn how to make their stuff... seriously Starbucks??!!! So disappointed!!!!! :'(
--------------------
Try the spinach and feta hummus, it is amazing. I had the chicken caesar pita and if was wonderful. The caesar dressing was very flavorful and the greens (romaine, mixed greens, etc) were good quality and flavorful (not your typical bagged junk). Pulling up the the place I was skeptical (they're in an old garage) but give it a try, well worth it.
--------------------
I just walked out of Heads and Tails and I can't  say enough about Jenne.  I was quite nervous to have a bikini wax and Jenne talked me though the whole process and it was not bad at all!  If you have sensitive skin and are looking for a clean place with an excellent staff - do not hesitate going here. Will be back!
--------------------
I had numerous things happen during my move and required additional services from this office. The guys in this office are top notch and are very trustworthy. I'd say more about how they took great care of me, but they may have gone above and beyond what they should have and afraid to say too much. I would recommend this office to my mother!
--------------------
Went here when they first opened. They only had one flavor... it wasn't that great. Everything was overpriced and we left spending about 70-80 dollars for three people and it wasn't filling. 
*it is not Cajun style seafood. The sauce tastes like a mixture between buffet style sauces with fish sauce. 
Giving them a solid three because there are better places to eat at
--------------------
Found this place on Yelp. The reviews speak for themselves and are so true. The sandwiches are really tasty. Definitely worth the wait in line. Fast and friendly service. We waited about 15 minutes in line, ordered 4 different sandwiches, filled up our sodas, walked out to our table, and our sandwiches were delivered to us as we say down. We enjoyed our meal.
--------------------
This place surpassed our expectations!  The steak is far superior to any steak house I have been too.  The staff flows together like a well trained team, the hostess Mallory, our waiter Max, and the busboy all keep things moving smoothly and leave you never wanting for anything.  Honestly the whole experience was amazing and we will be back for more. Love this place!
--------------------
The flavors continue to surprise me. I had Bananas Foster, Pear Champagne Sorbet, Blueberry Fig Sorbet, and Cassis sorbet. All flavors were good but the Cassis started off quite subtly and then the flavor gradually made itself known; the more I ate of it the better it tasted. It was well worth coming back with another group of friends to sample some frozen happiness.
--------------------
We went on a Friday night and the place was full, but even so there was only a 20 minute wait. 
The service was ... Hit and miss. I don't want to rip on our server too much because our server was obviously trying but just not hitting the mark. The food was Ok, but I don't believe I'll be back. It just wasn't great.
--------------------
The Loew's hotel is very clean and looks very nice. The service is amazing. My family and I wanted to stay for a whole month. The breakfast there is fantastic! My son said it looked like it was the future. That's how nice it was! The rooms were nice size and the parking is convenient. That's why I give the Loew's hotel 5 stars.
--------------------
For many years, RH&B was the place to go in south Jersey for great BBQ and blues. Sadly, after a recent sale, the restaurant has decided to cancel all live music. The food was decent at best, and in the absence of live music offerings  I can no longer recommend this restaurant. The only aspect I will miss are the people who worked there.
--------------------
I concur with the other comments that this place is awful.   The service here was about as bad as I have ever seen.   The food arrived cold and had to be sent back - which of course turned into a big ordeal.  

Until the management here shows some leadership and sets some higher expectations of their service and kitchen staff, I would avoid this place.
--------------------
Ordered fresh made pie, not reheated slices.  Some of the best pizza I've had in philly, because of the tasteful and crunchy crust and good amount of toppings.  Had a Cowboy steak with no BBQ sauce and couldn't stop myself at two slices.  Got the same pizza again with bbq sauce and it was just as good so now I do half and half.
--------------------
It is what you expect in an Acme, the only thing I found a little different with this one is that it seemed the aisles were a little narrower than in other stores. Store is a little smaller than others so not as wide of a variety, but was fine, looks like they've upgraded some areas like the frozen/refrigerated food sections. Service was fine.
--------------------
I am a long term frequent customer of this establishment. I just went in to order take out (3 apps) and was told they're too busy to do it. Really? The place is maybe half full at best. Does your dick reach your ass? Yes? Go fuck yourself! I'm a frequent customer AND great tipper. Glad that Kanella just opened. NEVER going back to dmitris!
--------------------
Very disappointed. We went to eat  at 2:15 on Saturday and were told the kitchen closed at 2. Their website says: Sat & Sun all day. Their website claims that they are open until 5.
I'm always a bit suspect of places that can't manage simple details like their hours on their website. It makes me wonder about the awareness to quality and other "small" items.
--------------------
This place is a gem.Attractive space, great location near Broad Street line, plenty on street parking. BYOB. I've been twice and enjoyed every dish. Highlights were the chaats, beef short ribs, lamb vindaloo, beet salad, breads/pickles, and chai. We got the chocolate cake for the table to share each time and everyone loved it. Can get takeout beer at the corner bar. We'll be back.
--------------------
When I ordered my pizza for me and my friends , he pizza was so small and this delivery girl took forever and she was rude and didn't want to give me my change back and she said she thought I gave her a tip no ! And she didn't even give me the right change and it was all coins ! This place sucks ! DONT EAT HERE !!!!!!
--------------------
Food was good, we took advantage of the Sunday Buffet it included fried chicken, greens, smother steak, corn, cabbage.  It was so much more  It was very,very cozy. You would actually think you were eating at your grandmother's house.  This is not a fine dining establishment.  The price was fair, was highly recommended by locals. It's was worth any wait. This place exceeded my expectations.
--------------------
Some of the finest Mexican food I've had. The fried fish taco is WONDERFUL, as is all of the other food. My biggest regret is not buying their red sauce and birria to take home. 

Also-there is no air conditioning. They do have ceiling fans, but we all know those aren't necessarily helpful in the monsoon season. The food is definitely worth the trip though!
--------------------
Great hiking, biking, running spot. Lots of well maintained paths. Beautiful views and spots with shade which is great when you're hiking in the heat. Only complaint is that people don't follow the dogs on leash rule and I came across at least 6 dogs off leash and away from their owners. Just follow the rules or they will make it a no dog spot!!!!
--------------------
A great restaurant to take people visiting from out of town. Very popular for breakfast/brunch on the weekends. Should expect to wait at least an hour any time after 9:30 AM and service takes a little while. But great menu options and delicious food. Also a great bakery, coffee and gelato counter that offers instant service or items to enjoy while waiting to get called.
--------------------
This was my 1st visit here.  Overall, not that impressed!  To start with parking was really bad!  There are good choices of beer on draft.  The food was ok.  We split a few appetizers.  The fried olives were very tasty & different!  The rest of the appetizers were ok: the blue cheese chips, calamari, & meat/cheese platter.  I would try this place again, but overall not thrilled!
--------------------
Burger was OK, but not at all worth the price. I felt cramped sitting at the long table surrounded by people I did not know. Service was OK. If they brought the prices way down, it would be better. As it is now, it's a really expensive, mediocre burger. There are much, much better places in St. Louis (both in terms of taste and value).
--------------------
Yum! This is a great place to go with a few friends to share their delicious and nicely portioned cheese while enjoying a beer from their extensive drink list. 5 stars purely because of how much I loved their cheese selection and appreciated the staff's knowledge of each cheese.  I'd happily go back although this is not a place I'd go to have inexpensive drinks.
--------------------
This place is amazing!  They make the donuts fresh with each order.  In fact, I had to wait 10 minutes for them to cool down before I could eat them.  This location is clean and never super busy.  Its a really great addition to the neighborhood and people with cars are sure to appreciate the parking lot.  Best donuts in Philly and the Delaware Valley.
--------------------
I was new to the Westchase area and I was in need of a new dentist.  After reading reviews and the location being on .5 miles from my place I made an appointment.  The entire staff is great.  I've visited with Dr. Creech-Gionis  and Dr. Stern, they both are outstanding.  They make going to the  dentist less painful.  I can honestly say I'm 100% satisfied.
--------------------
I had take out from here tonight so this review is solely the food. My first time here even though I live around the corner. I ordered the Buffalo chicken salad with romaine letteus and blue cheese dressing. It was amazing! Greens were fresh and crispy, blue cheese dressing not full of chunks, and chicken delicious. I will definitly be going back for this salad.
--------------------
Solid improvement since last visit.  

Service- much improved.  Kid named Dillon gave a great service.  

Ambiance is very casual.  Order and sit, they bring food to you. 

Food- tasty and lots of options.  Not fancy.  Very affordable.  

Family of four for about 30$.  That's a great deal w today's prices. 

If you are looking for a fast, casual Asian option, give this place a try.
--------------------
As motels go this one is very nice for the rate. Clean, comfortable and well-managed. You get what you pay for so the breakfast buffet is just OK. The pool is too small to swim laps (disappointing). The lobby area is spacious and comportable. 

If you are looking for a moderately priced place to sleep that is clean and comforable this will suit you just fine.
--------------------
I loved this place.  Walking by, I almost didn't go in, because Im a vegetarian and it looked like there was only meat on the menu. I'm glad that I looked closer. They have an excellent veggie burger, a terrific selection of local microbrews and they even make their own ice cream. I would definitely go back here again the next time I visit St. Louis.
--------------------
This is my first choice whenever we decide to go out to dinner! They have a huge selection of foods that will fit any type of person who will be dining there. Their staff is super nice and will accommodate to whatever your needs may be! The restaurant itself is beautiful and very relaxing. In my opinion, Fellinis of media has the best Italian cuisine around.
--------------------
I am from Colorado and am visiting Santa Barbara and let me tell you... what a great place to eat. The food was quality, but the customer service was even better. Also, I thought the price was really good for the amount of food you get. Food came out fast as well. Overall, I'd say it's a great breakfast place if you are in Santa Barbara
--------------------
Absolute garbage company. Trying to get from Indy to Chicago and they are more than an hour late, did not inform me of the delay, and their entire customer policy (feel free to read it on the website) consists of "we cannot be held responsible for anything." Sitting at a bus stop with 20 people whom are all having their time wasted with absolutely no recourse.
--------------------
I know I shouldn't expect much but everything I asked for that was on the drive thru menu was not available. I was actually afraid of what I was going to get once I did get it. I saw the movie "waiting".  Word of advice stay clear of this arch. Just so you know I was only trying to order a beverage how pathetic is that.
--------------------
Have eaten at this place 3 times. Every time was a good experience for me and the kids. No smoke No noise and good food good service. Maybe because it has always been on a late tuesday afternoon we have eaten there. I have always ordered something different and have been satisfied  and happy with what I got. Definitely will be back to eat there again.
--------------------
We recently moved from Brooklyn, NY and have been in search of some really good pizza...and here it is! We were so happy to bite into a thin crispy crust! It was awesome, the service was amazing and we couldn't be more pleased. I highly recommend this place if you love great pizza and excellent customer service! They will surely get our business again and again.
--------------------
Took my vehicle here for some work a few years ago for a manufacturer recall. Problem went away and then started hearing another noise which I thought was related, but turned out was a completely different issue. Kevin and his mechanic lifted my car right up and fixed the issue FREE OF CHARGE even though I told them I'd pay. Outstanding individuals for doing that. Highly recommend!
--------------------
Sweet spot in the Waterline. Came for some live music with friends on Saturday. Very cool. Best local beer in town by far. Seems like the concept is a few notches up from Fig Mountain. Definitely prefer Topa. Even cooler is that you can order incredible food from the Nook Restaurant, and walk two feet into Lama Dog which is part of the Waterline. I love it!!
--------------------
Excellent place to get a tattoo. I have had two done at B13 and am really pleased with both. One was with a group of people and the owner was able to fit all 4 of us in with a great sketch on really short notice. If you aren't sure who to go to, I've seen especially awesome work by Amanda, though everyone is great I'm sure.
--------------------
Smokey (to be expected - minus a star as a non smoker with allergies), several dining options (prices varies), beverages (all sorts for a nominal fee, of course), hotel (pricey), parking (FREE), entertainment (various), ATM (scared for some people who may not have self control), and yes gambling (tip: don't gamble if you're bit willing to lose it). Have fun even if you are an observer (like me).
--------------------
Tasty selection and very preppy! 

One cannot go wrong with the What's Up Doc omelet. One complaint with the omelets is the actual size, they seem to fluctuate. Clearly a difference in 4-5 extra bits worth of omelet. 

If you have a sweet tooth, any of french toasts are great! Fancy Breakfast Sandwich is great! I substituted the prosciutto with bacon and got great results! Great mimosas!
--------------------
Not too sure why all the negative reviews. I was in and out within 5 mins. Maybe it was because I wasn't looking for something elaborate, who knows. Anyways, I got exactly what I needed and the employees were courteous. The store was organized, well stocked and clean. Unfortunately for this area however, I don't see them staying in business. So many other places near by closed.
--------------------
My wife and I stoped in for a couple of glasses of wine in the bar area.  It was a nice festive atmosphere.  Santa and Mrs. Clause even made a brief appearance.  The service was a little slow but we were ok with it because we wanted to take our time anyway.  We had a good time and the ambience is nice for a drink or 2.
--------------------
Yats is the best Cajun Food that we have ever eaten and is quite economical to enjoy.  The menu is quite eclectic in that they cook each day what they want to cook and put it on a chalkboard.  You just never know what kind of tasty delight you will find on any one day.  This is a regular place to visit for my wife and I.
--------------------
I was impressed with this pizza place's selection.  I stopped in for a quick bite and ordered a roast beef sandwich (that was very delicious.)  The sandwich did take about 15 to 20 minutes to get out of the kitchen.  Seating is non-existent in the restaurant, but there is a community patio next to Castrillo's.  I am excited to try their pizza.  I've only heard good things.
--------------------
First time eating here today, was fantastic! The food was great but the REAL REASON to go is view and ambience. Sitting outside right on the beach, enjoying your meal while listening to the soothing sound of waves crashing is simply sublime. Another plus, they sell beer! Lol. A must if you're in the area, even if you're not it's worth the drive. I'll definitely be back!
--------------------
My husband and I took my mother here for her 100th birthday!
We can't say enough about the treatment we received: from a great table and view, to delicious "compliments of the chef" extra dishes, to a beautifully decorated cake plate, to the warm and attentive servers. It was much more than we expected, even for this very special occasion. For us, it was a wonderfully memorable experience.
--------------------
The owner of this location (and two others including Southampton) reached out to me after my previous review. We ended up talking for half an hour and I was very impressed with his approach to business... he's definitely the type of person I want to do business with. I returned to Saladworks on two separate occasions and the service had vastly improved. The new summer salads are wonderful!
--------------------
I've only been to their casino and I love that its only an hour away from Orlando yet it feels so far. The atmosphere is typical of most casinos with the exception of over priced burgers and fries at the Hard Rock Cafe. 

I had some luck on the Breakfast at Tiffany's slot machine and as a lover of the movie, it was a fun one to play.
--------------------
Great oyster happy hours that go on from 5-7pm! My boyfriend and I shared a dozen oysters and a glass of champagne. Our tab was $24 with tip. Great value! I hear they have the best to-go cups in town, and we totally missed out on that. The staff were very nice and attentive. We almost felt too casual but we felt at home! I'd definitely go back :)
--------------------
I love Bing's boba!!!!!!!!! The Taro snow is my go to drink. Definitely the best boba spot in Tucson! The place is always clean. They have board games for you to play. The staff is helpful and friendly. My husband ordered a drink that unfortunately was not at the right flavor level. He told the staff and they made him a new drink that was to his liking.
--------------------
I absolutely love coming here. Great outdoor place with a wine selection you can't find anywhere else (not your typical wines you find in the grocery). The live music today was fabulous - and on a Thursday afternoon! Come here, get a few cheeses and wine and you will be satisfied. Oh, and the regular menu is crafty and artistic. It's a beautiful place with ambiance and on the palate.
--------------------
This place is nothing short of astounding.  I went in for my first Brazilian and decided to get a blow-out as well.  These women are incredible in every way, from their work to their personalities. I've never felt more comfortable and relaxed under such intimidating circumstances (THANKS JENNE!).  Oh, and they're both comedians, so be ready to laugh the whole time you're here :)  Can not wait to go back!
--------------------
The restaurant smelled like a toilet.  I couldn't stand it.  My daughter and I got the meals to go and the guy put them in the same box.  She doesn't eat fish and that is what I got.  I know it's a sushi restaurant but she likes the California rolls.  I got the spicy tuna roll.  It was mediocre.  My daughter did enjoyed hers.  Will not be going back.
--------------------
I'm pretty sure this place has been open since before I was born and it's no surprise as to why. 

The absolute classic of an American diner, polite and attentive waitresses and most of their food made entirely from scratch. I would definitely say their fried chicken is the best I've had before, and fresh! Bottomless coffee too, for $1.75 which I think is quite reasonable. Nice pie, too :)
--------------------
Pina's is easily one of the mroe underated places to eat in Roxborough. They have great stromboli (which are HUGE) and thier sicilian pie is the best I have every had. Sandwiches and pizza are just ok. 

I stopped ina two occassions for a sit down dinner and came away very stisfied and full. Ordered the chicken park with was a huge chickem covered in cheese and sauce. Excellent.
--------------------
As far as I know, this is the best video rental store in existence.  The staff is knowledgeable and friendly, but the selection really sets it apart.  Suppose you want to rent the newest release and a VHS of the best hockey fights of the 1970s...They would probably have both available at a very low cost.  I only wish that there was a place like Casa Video in Chicago.
--------------------
We had an alumni event here and I really enjoyed it. It's dimly lit, very cozy inside - it's decorated kind of like an old library. It was a great quiet,casual spot if you're looking for a low key place to have good drinks. 

They have a few beers and wines, but we focused mostly on the happy hour cocktails - moscow mules, old fashioneds, etc. Everyone loved theirs, no complaints!
--------------------
Its a great place for Brunch.
We tried the Wildflower Triple where you can substitute any of the 3 items with sausage or biscuit or anything else. We couldn't figure out which one we wanted to try, so this choice was easy! 
The food was spectacular and the service was very friendly! 
We are here for two more days, so we might come back tomorrow or the day after.
--------------------
Finally got to eat here last night. Eclectic foodie menu. I had their onion tart as an app and Kerry had the veal meatballs with sauce on polenta, very delicious. The red gravy tasted like my own. We both ordered the special of citrus short ribs with fat noodles and brussel sprouts, peas. couldn't finish we will be back to try other interesting items. Small crowded but great friendly atmosphere
--------------------
They have great prices if you order family style. We tried the pot roast and it was just as good carry out as it would have been at the restaurant. They packaged everything nicely and it stayed warm after the 30 min car ride. There was definitely enough for a family of 4. The green beans were amazing! I would definitely recommend. It's nothing special, just a good family restaurant
--------------------
The service is super friendly! During my exam, Dr. Dinh was very kind and addressed my concerns. Also, I am very picky when it comes to choosing frames so it was a good thing they had a nice selection to choose from. The receptionist was also very helpful and patient with me during the process haha. Overall experience was great and I will definitely come back for my yearly exam.
--------------------
Busy place, but we were offered extra- special coffee while we waited. No sooner than it was ready, so was our table. The server was welcoming and offered suggestions for us after we made her aware of some dietary restrictions. My daughter and I shared a salad, entree, and Special grits. Every bite was delicious, beautifully presented, and reasonably priced as downtown prices go. We like this restaurant a lot.
--------------------
Few years ago this used to be the best. Wasnt that price they had a ton of stuff staff always helpful and friendly. I bough a part once it was faulty returned it they gave me my money back no question about it. Another time I bough a part I didnt need returned that too money in hand no question. Starting to go down now but still pretty decent place
--------------------
We arrived for lunch at 12p on a Friday - wasn't busy at all. It took FOREVER to get anything. We were really pleasant and kind but we had to complain several times to get any beverages that we ordered. It took them 40 minutes to let us know that a beer we ordered was no longer available. The food was great, but not worth the lengthy wait and slow service.
--------------------
Originally, our little group headed to Franklin Fountain and the line was around the block-- Capofitto was only a few steps away with no line (and bonus--cheaper/better dessert treat!). We only popped in for gelato, but I would love to come back for the pizza! It looked and smelled really good. Gelato was amazing, as capogiro gelato always is. Highly recommend chocolat scurio and pera as a combo--it was perfect!

Our animals are an extension of our family.  So, we aren't going to take them to any old place for boarding, grooming and medical examinations.  I'm a big fan of the Animal Clinic because they treat the pets as if they were their own pets.  You can't ask for any more.  I would have given them 5* but the location is a little difficult to get out of when leaving.
--------------------
Favorite place in Nashville for breakfast!! This is a must go to spot!! Near Vandy and always busy...park in the back lot and be sure to get the parking ticket from the machine so you won't be charged...its free parking for a specified amount of time. My favorite is banana pancakes...think banana bread only in a pancake!! Perfection!!!! I don't leave Nashville until I go here to eat my pancakes!
--------------------
Great breakfast fare and all. Eggs provençale was pretty good; all kinds of herbs and seasonings, but cooked inconsistently. Tomato on the side was awesome.

Omelets were executed well, and the pastries were pretty impressive.

But the coffee was horrendously bad. And without good coffee, what's the point of breakfast?

And I still can't trust restaurants that have misspellings on their menus. Even if the misspelling is from another language.
--------------------
The event started at 1 and we got there about 1:30. It was so packed you could not enjoy yourself. Most of tents were not even wine, either advertisment, beer, or food you had to pay for. By 3 o' clock most of the tables were out of everything... It was suppose to go till 5?! Definitely was not worth the money and probably will not be back next year.
--------------------
We arrived at Happy Hour, 50 cent oysters and half price drinks, so we had both, the ordered the beet salad (divine), mussels, and flammenkuchen (an appetizer I used for my entree),  All were excellent.  I first had flammenkuchen (or tarte flambe) in Strasbourg at a street fair, this was far and above that experience, with caramelized onions resting atop the cheese and hunks of bacon strewn around.  So good!
--------------------
Was rather disappointed in the service.  We found our own table as requested to do but wait staff continually walked by without even acknowledging us.  After ordering a flight of their beers, again it was a long wait.  Not impressed by any of the beers.  One even tasted like soap.  Have tried other flights at other breweries and find it a great way to pick a favorite.  But not here.
--------------------
The pizza was the best we've had in the Fairmount/Art Museum/Brewerytown area and we've probably tried 5 or so.  The pepperoni was a little crispy (good thing) and the wings were, too.  That last one is really surprising since there are so many soggy wings out there.  Lazos does it right.  They gave me Sprite instead of Coke but otherwise this was a very good pizza+wing combo.  Will order again!
--------------------
Service here was excellent. They hosted us for an event and were awesome. 

However, I felt that is where the awesome stopped. The food I had (brisket) was mediocre at best, maybe it had been sitting under lamps all day? The bread it was served on was tough. The mac and cheese was pretty good. My glassware for beer was dirty, chilled, and they were out of everything on draft.
--------------------
Visited Shaving Grace on Friday for a hair cut.

Same vibe as my old Barber Shop in Philly. 
Big TV in the waiting area. Plush couch to relax in. Young lady checking me in asked if I wanted water, soda or a beer.
Beer? Need I say more. 

Great cut. Great bunch of guys discussing current events, sports, and what's happening around town.
Found my new spot. 

Will be back.
--------------------
This place was awesome! I am driving cross country and hit a busted tire on the road and something came off the bottom of my car.  I called and Brian told me to come in and he would take a look.  They put my car up right away and patched things up. He was really nice and had me on my way in less than 30 minutes.  Definitely recommend this place.
--------------------
I read at least 30 reviews before I decided to eat here. The only thing that was good was the oysters because it's raw. Everything else was dry and tasteless. The space is cramp. We had people on our backs coughing on us while sitting at the bar trying to enjoy it. Let's just say the 2 half and half baskets that my boyfriend and I ordered was not worth $60.
--------------------
this place SUCKS. Terrible service and overpriced mediocre food. This is my second time with the same results. I gave them the benefit of the doubt -perhaps having an off night the first time I went, but it was the exact same the second time around. Nothing innovative. They churn tables out and could care less that you are spending upwards of $150 for two. Save this one for the tourists.
--------------------
Hands down best breakfast in Philly!  I've only been here for four months, but I have tried nearly every "Best of" spot in town.  I'm a breakfast fanatic so I get little over critical.  However, this small cafe has managed to create incredible flavor while keeping their dishes fresh and simplistic.  While the actual space is "cozy," this menu could easily keep a place as big as Parc overflowing with patrons.
--------------------
Stopped in for breakfast on 12/2/17 I used to like it here for breakfast.  Service was slow coffee was not hot, grits were only warm and twenty minute wait for cinnamon biscuit after breakfast was brought to table then ten minutes to pay at counter to get out of the place there are better places to get breakfast in the area.  Should have went with my first choice instead of here.
--------------------
Great atmosphere and service! I don't know how often they have live music but the band playing the night we stopped in was very good. As for the food, it was good; I wont say it was the best burger I ever had but it wasn't bad; just not as great as I had hoped it would have been. All and all we had a good time and will be back!
--------------------
Gets two stars because the service was great and staff was very friendly, food was not very good.. maybe we came on a bad day. I ate there and ordered a togo item for my husband. I asked the girl working the counter to pick the most popular thing out of the German section for him and it was literally just a pretzel and a piece of sausage in a box.
--------------------
My boyfriend and I tried this deli for the first time today. I had a turkey, avocado & bacon panini and he ha a buffalo chicken wrap. We will definitely be returning. The wait for food wasn't too long, which is always appreciated during lunch hour. There was SO much to choose from. They have salads, soup, macaroni, sandwiches and hot food. I love a deli that has many options to choose from!
--------------------
Yes! I love this place! Maple Street Patisserie is the bomb.com! I've never been disappointed. Best blueberry muffin I've ever had in my whole entire life. Delicious breakfast and lunch spot. They also do specialty cakes so swing by during Mardi Gras and grab a king cake. Also the owner, Ziggy, is the man. He's always running around working crazy hours to make all these scrumptious baked goods. Can't beat this place :)
--------------------
The food at Ghini's is just delicious. Everything for French breakfast imaginable, and more. I highly recommend the eggs provencale, not something you can get anywhere else. Two eggs basted with a sliced hot house tomato, thyme, garlic and herbs de provance. Get the baguette toast and add the great hashbrowns for a mere dollar.
My personal favorite are all the crepes, both sweet and savory. Especially recommend the spinach and swiss.
--------------------
I was craving for Ramen when I found this gem, but it wasn't the Ramen that I'm rating here (it falls a bit short comparing to the Ramens I've had in NY). That Steven roll!!! That was one of the best rolls that I've had! Good thing I was pretty hungry and asked for roll recommendations. I was definitely not disappointed. I would love to come back once I visit Philly again.
--------------------
We're new to the area, so we're exploring restaurants every weekend. My wife has already proclaimed The Roost her favorite, and that's based on many years of breakfast dining, not just in this area. They bake all their own breads and pastries. Try the raisin bread or sugar-cinnamon toast. Yum! The cornbread casserole is another dish my wife and I highly recommend. And the service was prompt, attentive and very friendly. Enjoy!
--------------------
My go-to spot on a Saturday night! I was real bummed that lucys closed, but was pleasantly surprised by this bar just across the street!
Their food is better than expected. I always get wings and fries. (be careful of the wtf sauce though) Sometimes it takes a real long time to get the bartenders attention, but the place is usually packed. And if you're lucky the always sunny crew will pop in!
--------------------
Totally worth the wait despite the heat!  I had the Vegan grits with a biscuit on the side. OMG!  So good. My 3 sisters each enjoyed their choices as well. Caution, the bloody Mary's are spicy!  The service was excellent. Really considering the wait was 45 mins, the line moved fast and then there was no long wait for our food. They have their process perfected!  Thanks Biscuit Love for a Delish breakfast!!!
--------------------
Went there due to having a gc, and was suprised at the great food!  Had the sauteed stirfry over spinach, and my gf had the abundant pile of nachos.  They have a pretty decent selection of other delectables, and the day time bartender was very pleasant.  I would recommend to someone who wants a friendly atmosphere with decent food in a sports bar setting.  They actually do have sports playing on the tvs.
--------------------
Walked by this place and decided to check it out. Great beer and burger place, made even better knowing many things were organic. You can order from the menu, or create your own burger. They also have rotating beers and specials. Nice atmosphere and staff. Burgers don't come with anything, so order from the sides if you want some fries. (There's also sandwiches and salads if you don't want a burger) Vegetarian friendly.
--------------------
Wawa is like a beacon in a cold, dark world.  I grew up around Sheetz locations, but I have to admit that I prefer Wawa.  The sandwiches are really good, and they have the typical snacks/drinks you would expect from a convenience store.  This particular location is not quite as friendly as the one I go to near the office, but whatever.  I can still walk out with all of my snacking requirements.
--------------------
Pricey ( a ham and cheese croissant was $5.50)  as with anywhere in Santa Barbra but very delicious. Cute space ( a bit hard to find ). The green eggs and ham  breakfast biscuit is to die for.  ($10 I think) The Santa Barbra tri tip sandwich was excellent! Cold brew coffee was good. Lots of good choices in the grab and go section, and our salami and pesto sammy was also great. I'd go back!
--------------------
Pretty good bagels, be sure to ask for extra cream cheese if you like a lot. The people are always pleasant which is unique to Dunedin. The bad thing is the guy doesn't wash his hands or wear gloves. He took a previous customers money, my money,  used the phone and wiped his nose, then he made my bagel. I won't go back. If this doesn't bother you, the bagels are pretty good.
--------------------
I worked with the Sultans of Schlep last week on a small move within center city. I had a great experience for a number of reasons:

-Tom is extremely attentive, responsive, and easy to work with
-They have fair prices
-The movers were on time and worked efficiently
-They provided wardrobe boxes at no extra cost
-They have a cool and funny name (don't you think?)

I would definitely work with them again!
--------------------
Overpriced and underwhelming.  Had the sausage/egg:cheese sandwich this morning on whole grain $4.89. Sausage was cold and the sandwich was about 1/2 the size of the picture on the menu. It comes on these large plates and it's just a embarrassing.  Husband had bacon/egg/cheese on brioche, $4.89 and his egg was cold and the entire sandwich was greasy.   I can get this kind of food at McDonalds for a fraction of the price.
--------------------
Bummer, just moved to this area and this was my first visit to this location.  I didn't receive my change or receipt,  it was just change but I asked for it and she said she gave it to me, um no. Was in a hurry so I didn't wanna argue.  And no spoon for my chili. Cheese on my burger was old, which means my burger wasn't freshly made. Tasted ok but won't return.
--------------------
As an active runner my shoes are my life force. Endurance House has a fantastic selection of shoes for all runners.  The staff are always nice and helpful. What sets them apart from other stores is how they check for what shoe will best suit your stride and reduce injury.  I will happily keep coming back and know that I will get a good price, a great pair of shoes, and have personalized help.
--------------------
This place's posted hours include a 10PM closing time. 

I walked in at 8:30 and, as soon as I got to the counter, the guy said to me "kitchen's closed." The grill, fryers, etc were all being covered up. 

First of all, if your kitchen is closed, why is the door to your restaurant unlocked? 

Secondly, I could see this being the case if I walked in at, say, 9:55PM. But 8:30? That's ridiculous.
--------------------
not a bad little burger joint. i got the bacon cheeseburger. bacon was cooked perfect and had the perfect thickness. bun had a really great toasted crust. fries were good, as well as the chocolate shake I had. 3 complaints, i wish the burger was more juicy, I wish I wasn't paying so much for the tiny burger portion I was served, and I wish I didn't leave the place smelling like burger grease.
--------------------
I like this place a lot. I stopped in once with friends for drinks and was eager to return for food. We finally did over the weekend. 

The ambience is very nice -- somehow ideal for both a fun date as well as for a beer and sports crowd. 

I love the open kitchen. 

Great beer selection. 

I'll definitely return for the rosemary fries, and my fiancée will return for the very good house burger.
--------------------
What a hidden gem of a restaurant.  While everyone else go to Taco Bus and stands in long lines I'll come here to Taco Son and get just as good of food without the lines. Everything here is made from scratch and you can taste the freshness of the ingredients.  The portions are big so you get your monies worth. Oh and their breakfast burritos are killer grab you one after a long night.
--------------------
Stopped in tonight for a light bite to eat. I was so impressed! Great service, great fresh, fresh food and beautiful atmosphere- we sat outside in the warm October evening air.  Lisa was a great host, explaining the menu and checked in with us frequently - we ended up chatting with her quite a bit and that only made the whole evening more enjoyable. What a wonderful place- we will certainly be back for more!
--------------------
Don't let the outside fool you-this place is much cuter and nicer inside than you would expect! 

Food is good and reasonably  priced. We ordered papaya salad, triple flavor duck, and king tofu soup. Papaya salad is always refreshing, but this place overdoes it on the fish sauce. Anything triple flavor is always a safe but delicious choice. I would say their king soup, with choice of protein, is a winner. 

And also, BYO!
--------------------
I don't give five star ratings very easily but my wife and I just had a fantastic experience. Debbie was our waitress and she was simply exceptional. Explained the menu and specials as well as answering all my questions. Food was very good, came out fast and hot. Prepared exactly how it was ordered. Will be back. 
Mac n cheese burger was dope fiend!  
Drinks were spot on as well. Whisky sour was great.
--------------------
I stopped here because it was by the hotel I was staying in. The guys working at the shop were super nice and friendly. I really like the buy one get one deal they do. I also ordered some hot wings and they were pretty good. They had a ton of sauce on them which is awesome. Next time I come back to town I will be sure to stop here for some more pizza!
--------------------
I will get straight to the point..... If you are ever anywhere near Camden NJ, In fact if you are anywhere in the State of NJ, get to Santana's for breakfast and pastries.   Their coffee puts Starbucks, DD, Micky D's and all the rest to shame!!   Their pastries are INCREDIBLE!!  You would have to fly to Boricua ( Puerto Rico) to even come close!!    My business is in neighboring Pennsauken, and we are there every morning!!!
--------------------
Ew. I don't know what upsets me more, the borderline gross food or how much I had to pay for it. We waited forever to get into this place which served me a relatively tasteless burger on an incredibly soggy McDonald's quality bun and the saltiest fries I have ever eaten. Yes, truffle oil is delicious, but pouring it over burned, greasy fries does not a delicious, 16 dollar meal make. We won't be back.
--------------------
ZERO STARS!! This place is dirty and disorganized.  There were yellowed OLD newspapers piled on top of a dusty fake tree in the waiting area.  Jenna did my nails so poorly I had to return TWO times in one week for repairs while she scolded and argued with me the whole time. 
 I see no FUTURE for this place or in MY FUTURE.  Don't waste your time or money. This is the Lehigh Acres location.
--------------------
All of hype about Federal Donuts made me a little worried it wouldn't live up to it's reputation. But, it absolutely did. I'm a vegetarian so I can only personally comment on the donuts and coffee; however, my husband is obsessed with the chicken. His favorite is the buttermilk ranch.

The donuts are pretty amazing. Paired with an iced coffee and it doesn't get any better. The staff couldn't be nicer- even when they're busy.
--------------------
This Chipotle location was great! I wanted to thank Chipotle for recognizing teachers for Teacher Appreciation Week! 
The line was very small and they served quickly as a pose to another location that had the line wrapped around the store! 
Their food is always fresh, tasteful and fulfilling! 
My go to is always the bowl with white cilantro lime rice,black beans, steak and all the toppings! 
Must eat with a bag of fresh tortilla chips!!
--------------------
Ice cream wasn't the best, and definitely not for the price. But it was there when I was passing through Belmawr, and it hit the spot when I needed to satisfy my sweet tooth! 

The service was friendly, albeit a little slow. And the place has a cute, quaint charm about it with the decor. If I lived in the area I'd probably return, but I wouldn't make any special trips to go back here.
--------------------
Allegro's is great. The pizza is really cheap, and lightning fast. My favorite was the sicilian, followed by the, uh, meaty kind, followed in a close third by anything stuffed (sometimes the centers were cold). They also sell beer, but I can't comment much on that because when I lived in Philadelphia I was under 21.
The only downside is the service (occasionally rude) and the constant crazies that hang out there talking to themselves.
--------------------
Such an awesome place to get cocktails! Yes, the drinks are a bit pricey (to me at least), but even the glassware is cool and designs you've rarely seen. The cocktails are delicious- Dragon's Tear, Blackmail and I'm sure I had a third. My friends couldn't get enough either. 

The music fits just perfectly with the laid back, mix-matched decor. I wasn't nuts about their choice of food, but for drinks I'll definitely be back.
--------------------
We started with the artichoke dip, big mistake. It was cold and the chips were stale. Mentioned to our waitress, but nothing came of it.  We ordered a large pizza, thin crust which after adding toppings it was a bit pricey for pizza.  Pizza was ok, not great. Except for not being our advocate our server was good.  I have been here before for Cardinals game, it was better then. Will try another venue next time.
--------------------
I think this Nordstrom's shoe department is better than other locations.  There was a lot of variety and they carry some higher end lines here.  The sales professionals were very good.  A gentleman named Erwin helped me locate two pairs of shoes throughout the Nordstrom's network AND price matched them to Bloomingdale's clearance sale price.  And no charge for shipping and handling.  Nordstrom's has won my loyalty due to the very high level of customer service!
--------------------
We stopped here for my Chai and Hubby's coffee and caffeine mania. The line went quite fast, they're quick with the service especially not a lot of people at the time. My Chai came out good, awesome! One thing I forgot to do is to purchase more coffee for the house. They have lots for sale. But not too worry because we still have plenty of Starbucks coffee at home. What would life be without Starbucks?
--------------------
I would eat anything they served me. I haven't even had the pancakes yet and I'm sold. The line out the front door and down the sidewalk should be an indication that this place is awesome. I just had basic hashbrowns eggs and bacon, but it was so fab and the service was great! I will definitely go back and sit down to eat. Parking is a little difficult around there, but that's to be expected.
--------------------
After visiting with friends and indulging in lots of tastes, consider this my next order at Livery:

(01) Carriage House Margarita with its brandy twist
(02) All of the empanadas because I have no shame
(03) The Red Drum - it's a lovely fish dish, and it's a way to get a taste of the yuca fries.
(04) Churros (Take my advice and don't split 'em with anyone.)

Feel free to copy my order on your visit.
--------------------
We absolutely love everything we have tried here. Our favorite thus far has been the Backyard Bowl, although there are several more that we still need to try. My husband and I are always full after we each get a kids size, or split a large. The ingredients are good quality,  filling foods. For the quality of ingredients, the price is very reasonable. It can get pretty busy here, but have patience, it is worth the wait.
--------------------
Walked into the restaurant, with reservations, and many open tables.  I asked the manager for a window table and was responded with "they are all reserved."  Two hours later, when we left, still many open tables next to the windows.

Overall food was good.
I had the filet and she had the salmon.
The bottle of wine that was recommended was $75 and was not told prior to ordering it, just that it was the last bottle.
--------------------
Let's be honest, this place needs a face lift. It's starting to feel shady, I wouldn't even feel comfortable taking my small children here (if I had any, which I don't). The service is mediocre and everything looks tired. The comedy club doesn't feel cheerful or fun, it just feels like the back hallway of a banquet room.

Great parking and good location though. Please owners, please put some money into this place. It really needs it.
--------------------
We randomly decided to look for middle eastern food. Came up with Petra Restaurant near our home. Tried it with my family and liked it quite a bit. Try their Friday and Saturday special rice (it actually test like Indian fried rice) with lamb. Really tasty. Other things are very good too. Don't be discouraged with the location of the place, but food is good and inside of the restaurant is quite nice. Service is good too.
--------------------
The restaurant was very nicely decorated , and clean. There were six of us and everyone enjoyed their meals . I had the fried green tomatoes. They were perfectly seasoned and the sauce served with them was delicious. The down side is they arrived after everyone else had their meals . My friends had the chicken salad , the fried bologna sandwich and a cheeseburger. We shared the peach cobbler dessert and were not disappointed, get it with the ice cream !!
--------------------
I came here with a group of four and had a great experience. There are tons of interesting appetizers to try--we had dumplings with corn and mushrooms, wings, and some specials that are escaping me. Each of us also got an order of noodles. These are not chinatown noodle house portions, but they also aren't chinatown noodle house ingredients. Interesting, fresh, and tasty. Plus its a great deal and BYO to boot. Great addition to 10th street!
--------------------
Had not been for years.

We went for lunch. Great decor. Great wait staff. Personable and on the ball.

My bud had the fish special, serving was a bit small but delish he said.

I had the fattoush salad with chicken. Spicing was everything it should be. The chicken was good, just that. The lettuce was limp and so was the pita. Not an olive in sight.

Pricey, especially for lunch. We will not be rushing back.
--------------------
The hotel is beautifully done. It has a boutique feel and not like just a normal hotel like the Hilton. I had my birthday party there at the restaurant and it was so very nice. The service was wonderful and the rooms are beautiful. The air conditioner was pretty loud in our room but that is my only complaint. It's very close to Printers Alley which is so cool! 
I would definitely stay in this hotel again!
--------------------
So much care is given to healthy, delicious food (ex. Japanese squash rather than white potatoes in curry). Thay have nice touches like a welcome snack and straw wrappers twisted in a rose. The sauces are amazing, menu has so many options, they accomodate special dietary needs easily since everything is made from scratch; even the desserts have that extra touch using both white and black sticky rice. This is our go-to for Thai from now on!
--------------------
Yah Man was yah man! Go here and enjoy the atmosphere, the personal service and delicious Caribbean fare. The beef pie was yummy as was the chicken and island sampler plates. The bread pudding was to die for. We left full and happy. If you live in the Tampa area or are visiting you should go here! Nice people! BTW, this is the 3rd time I've posted on yelp just wanted to share this place, so good!
--------------------
This place might surpass me going to halal guys.Came in at 9:50, they close at 10; felt bad but this guy Jules was friendly throughout the whole ordeal, explained what I didn't know on the menu. Ordered the steak shwarma with rice with all the sauces. He even gave a sample of the Baba ganoush which was pretty good. The food however was.....ABSOLUTELY delicious!!! This had that healthy feel to it and was filling. Definitely coming back
--------------------
Taking over in the spot of the original Benton Park  Cafe is Cafe Piazza.  The atmosphere is really nice and super ST. LOUIS.  The mural on the ceiling is a very eclectic work of art. Ask them how they did it and look under the bar. Great food. Different from your standard breakfast food.  Kinda fancy, but not intimidating.  I would highly recommend this restaurant for three reasons: decor, location, and good, creative food for the price.
--------------------
The service is going to be slooooww. And the food okay. Do not come here if you are with a group more than 4 if you have to be anywhere because it will be slow. 

I came with a group and we were the only ones around and the service was still a mess. There were multiple servers around who watched one server struggle. I felt bad for her. She was making drinks, serving, and running food.
--------------------
If I'm basing my rating on the taste and quality of the food, then I must give it a five star rating! I did not mind the atmosphere, which admittedly leaves a bit to be desired. I was too busy eating our delicious dinners. My companion had Chicken Tikka and I had Malai Kofta. Definitely loved both of them and their prices were exactly what I would expect to pay. We are already planning our return trip.
--------------------
We had a very nice brunch here. The food was consistently quite good and the service was pretty efficient and courteous. The omelets were sumptuous, the beverages fun (including a bloody mary bar.. we did have to ask for fresh bacon as it had run out). 

I did the budget breakfast which hit the spot with scrambled eggs, roaster taters, and a sweet muffin. The fish tacos were also good. Nice al fresco dining on the patio.
--------------------
Not only was the food excellent, but the people here are beyond nice-and genuine. I had eggs Benedict. The poached eggs were good but the toast they were sitting on was excellent. We were given a cream pancakes to taste test by our awesome server, Tina. I can honestly say it was the best pancake I've ever tasted. So full of flavour-vanilla, and soft aa pillow.  They melted in my mouth. I didn't even use syrup. Stellar!
--------------------
I go to blow bar to get my brows done by natalie (brow specialist) which i highly recommend she is great does a great job on my eyebrows! But then i got a blow by victoria!! Wow i was impress i have thin, straight, dead hair and she left me with the biggest volume ive ever had!!! Tried another girl but didnt like it as much so victoria will be my girl for ever; very beautiful clean place!!!
--------------------
So my favourite Indian in St Louis is still Spice and Grill on Olive, Husband said lets have a change so we tried out Indias Kitchen this evening and ordered a portion of the goat curry.

Sorry to say this curry was not great, the sauce was very heavy on the salt and tomato and the goat was tough as an old boot, the naan bread was below mediocre. Only nice thing was the rice.  Very Very dissapointed
--------------------
Quick Read: Aside from the parking and occasional crowds -- this place is fantastic.

Thankfully, Buddy Brew is expanding -- a move that I hope will relieve some of the terrible parking issues. This place is a must-try in Tampa. The baristas are friendly, knowledgable, and efficient. The breakfast and lunch options are solidly tasty. The coffee is roasted with a level of care that I'm glad to see in Tampa. One of my absolute favorite places on the planet.
--------------------
This place came highly recommended from some family that has been here many times. Service was fast and friendly even though they were extremely busy. Food was very tasty with mostly basic fare for breakfast.  The Cajun tasso omelet was fantastic. Not too spicy but just enough. Hash browns were fluffy and delicious. Other food at the table was French toast and eggs over medium. Everybody left satisfied and full. Will def come back for more next visit.
--------------------
Outrageous birthday cake! We chose the Devils Food Cake - with vanilla buttercream icing. It was delicious beyond words! 12 adults who typically shy away from high calorie sweets - ate every last bite! The staff were super friendly & accommodating (we probably could have ordered a bit more advanced) - can't say enough positives about our experience. So glad to know I also have a location closer to me in Old City. Wish I could have another piece of that cake!!
--------------------
I could be craving pizza and be walking by and STILL not go in again. I will say the ingredients are definitely fresh and service was great however the pizza is just plain not good. The crust is so thin that the pizza is cold within a few minutes and it was just a little floppy and bland. I wanted to love this place but with so many other pizzerias in the area I won't be going back.
--------------------
My personal favorite wine and liquor store in Nashville.  The staff is usually very friendly and helpful without being pretentious.  You can ask for a $10 dollar bottle of wine recommendation without being scoffed at.  The selection is good and the prices are comparable with other liquor stores in town.  

One negative, the curb is a little bit high pulling in.  Don't gun it unless you want to scrape some rust off of the bottom of your car.
--------------------
We stayed at the Four Points for 3 nights in November, while here on business.  Nice hotel, and a good experience. 

Check in was a breeze.  We had a good price on the room via my Sheraton/SPG member and AAA discount, which included the free breakfast.  The hotel is literally 5 minutes from the airport, and there are several other hotels right on the same block.

Staff was friendly and helpful.  Room was fine, parking easy, quiet at night.
--------------------
Excellent food, good service, great location. 

My wife had shrimp and grits, I had the barbecued shrimp -- both were outstanding. The appetizers were good. The bread pudding was a tad dry in the city that is supposed to be the mother lode of bread pudding. 

Mr. B came close to snagging the fifth star but the service could have been more attentive and the place is freezing - - in July in New Orleans. Wear long sleeves or bring a jacket.
--------------------
I'm a Barbecue judge and this ain't barbecue.  Not in Texas, not in the southeast.  Not in KC.  An earlier reviewer nailed it perfectly.  The brisket is fatty pot roast.  No evidence of smoke.  Mushy texture like long braised  meat.  My sandwich was 75 percent fat.  Big meatless chunks of fat.  Either the owner doesn't care or he's left the place in the hands of employees who don't know any better. Sorry.  But you can do much better elsewhere.
--------------------
If you like to wait while several tables are open,  terrible service, a dirty restaurant, and very mediocre food that is overpriced for breakfast then you'll love this place! This was one of the worst breakfasts I've ever had. With First Watch around the corner and Pinky's up the street don't waste your time here. I know what you're thinking...but Todd First Watch and Pinky's are way more expensive....Bullsh#t. don't waste your time on this old broken down dump.
--------------------
First meal in New Orleans. I had the $15 lunch special, a seafood stew (with oyster meat, crab claws, shrimp, and redfish) that came with a surprisingly thoughtful salad. Yeah, it's weird: I'm not even a fan of seafood and, to be honest, I wasn't even really that hungry. Still, before I knew what I was doing I had wolfed down the entire thing. The spice, consistency, tenderness of the meat -- all was precisely just right. Well worth your while.
--------------------
So delicious! I am so happy Reno is getting more variety in it's restaurants. 
Bab Cafe has a great menu, service was quick even during the lunch rush. 
I had the Dak-Galbi Bibim-bab "teriyaki chicken." The meat was tasty, veggies were fresh, sauces were awesome. I also ordered a side of potstickers (because I can never resist potstickers) and they were so great. 
Only wish it were a little easier to get to, being downtown parking can be a challenge.
--------------------
STAY AWAY! I am a gold member, so I stay at Hamptons frequently. I have stayed here before, and it seems to be under constant construction. My room was dirty. I came back to give them another chance as it is close to my appointments. I show up for a four night stay, and they send me away because they are booked, but tell me I can come back tomorrow night. Seriously? I couldn't believe that. I wont be back.
--------------------
So it is a good friends birthday today and we all met up here. This place has a great, homey feel. It wasn't crowded at all. 

The service was prompt and friendly, my burger was good, not great. Menu said it's charbroiled...seemed more like pan fried, and the meat was well done / dry. Oh well. My buds and I were all having a good time.

Went down to the river and actually found some water!

Good times on Paradise road.
--------------------
They have combination deals that make rolls and sushi super cheap! The rolls are definitely on the smaller side, so you'll need to order up on the combination deal if you want to get full. Sashimi was actually more fresh than I thought it would be, considering the price! 

Also, the joint is sort of small, and the service is slow, but the place is BYO, so you can just head downstairs and bring up some beers while you're waiting.
--------------------
Xtreme Tacos has become one of my favorite places. Everything I have ever ordered has been DELICIOUS! We have probably gotten food between 8-10 times. I have e joyed everything! For sure, always have to get chips. Their homemade chips are to die for!! The salsa and quest are both excellent for dipping. 
Besides the delicious food, the people who work there are Xtremely friendly and helpful. The guy who is usually at the counter is so warm and welcoming!
--------------------
My absolute favorite cafe in the city. Their black and white latte is probably the best I've ever had (not too sweet and just the right amount of foam), soups are always really good (even for non-soup people) and there's just a lot of space to do work. The noise level is perfect, the music is at a perfect level, and I always enjoy when patrons bring their dogs. I'll keep giving them my business for as long as I can.
--------------------
By far the best deli I have ever been to in the US. YEP, the US. Lots of crazy choices and oh it is hard to pick!! The Muffalata is so big 4 people can share. It is so tasty and amazing! Go on Saturday or Thursday night when they have live music! The special is always a good pick and don't worry there are plenty of sides to choose from. Great Chili, potato salad and of course chips. GO NOW...
--------------------
I've been to many art museums and was surprised to see a museum this beautiful with such a great collection to be FREE! I was so happy to have had discovered this museum in my short time in Indianapolis. I loved the African Art and the Modern Art sections (although I did make a mistake taking out my camera for the Modern Art museums.. that's a no no). The outdoor sculpture garden and gift shop was awesome as well. Highly recommended!
--------------------
Best pizza ever... hands down.

Love the peeps running the place - former hockey player (ask him to pop his nose) and adorable, but tough as nails wife... very funny.

They make their own sausage and mozzarella here.  And God help you if you mispronounce Ricotta!!

Any of the pizzas are fab... we even eat the crusts - which is a rarity in our family.  Just dab it in the olive oil, and mayb ask for some of their viniagrette to dip too!
--------------------
Stayed for one week post Christmas. Unless you take adjoining rooms as a family, strangers conversations/coughs/clearing throats/fights/dogs barking etc feel as if they are in your bed with you. Only slept two out of seven nights after hotel cleared out after New Years. Connecting doors are very poorly insulated. Staff at hotel is superior...really excellent but Starwood needs to do something about insulating those doors. Have stayed many places with connecting doors and never experienced anything as bad. Poor materials used????
--------------------
I love this place...stop whenever I can; either at this location or the Philadelphia one. I could eat the cumin style lamb every day of the week. But honestly, all of their food is good. I'm definitely a fan of their rabbit appetizer. People can argue about how authentically Sichuan it is...whatever. The only place I've actually had Sichuan food taste exactly like they serve in Sichuan Province was when I went to Chengdu. This place is well worth eating at.
--------------------
The Tuck Special. So good I would drive all the way back out to Nashville from TX just to have it again. It's a mix of strange ingredients- brisket, egg, pimento cheese but combined they are an amazing flavor combination. My husband didn't care for the BBQ sauce on the table, but meat was pretty good. I can see how this place gets crowded, but if you have patience and look up the menu ahead of time, it should be manageable.
--------------------
First time tonight. We enjoyed our evening with a great server, Alison. She knew we had not been here before and helped us through everything. Most of all we spent a lot of time catching up with old friends, and we never felt hurried.

The food was great, and we tried everything from steaks to meat loafs. All was prepared to our request and the meals were great.

Look forward to coming back. Hope it is just as good next time.
--------------------
I can't say enough about Belinda and Jerry! They were so helpful and kind. I am a travel nurse and was leaving my car in Boise for the winter. I came in on a snowy December evening and Balinda reassured me that she would stay and wait for me and Jerry even drove me to my storage shed and helped me with my luggage.
I am so happy with storage experiemce here and with the service I received. I highly recommend!!
--------------------
First time here. Great bar and restaurant area. Open floor plan with plenty of TV's to watch the game. Attached to their O'Fallon brewery (in Maryland Heights, Missouri, a suburb of St. Louis). They ranked 2nd in the St Louis area last year for volume of beer sold by a micro brewery. Today, I tried the House Special IPA...a wonderful IPA, not too bitter, just right. Look for Troy behind the bar! (The only reason for 4 stars is no desserts....)
--------------------
I've been to this location many times when I lived in the area and although it is a chain and not exactly sexy, it does the job on many occasions.   If you need an oil change, this place is ok, if you need a state inspection this place does it.   The key is getting there when they are not busy or else you will wait.   

Again, nothing fancy here a pep boys is a pep boys but all in all decent stuff.
--------------------
Beautiful clean shop with knock your socks off Everything ...
Homemade breakfast tarts and chicken pot pies .
All sweets looked well beyond beautiful and delish.
I felt some of the items were a tad pricey considering the sizes being on a smaller size. But I know premium quality costs more .. 
It's a great place for locals and worth a trip if traveling from center city etc .
I found counter staff to be most friendly and engaging 
Will be back and certainly will recommend
--------------------
So I decided to give this place a shot after reading all the reviews on yelp. The place was dead but I have it a shot. The food was okay at best. I actually left there and went across the street to Charlie's. The place was packed and one bite of the redtop pizza and I cursed myself for not coming here first. If you want a sit down meal this place is nice. If you want good pizza go to Charlie's.
--------------------
I have been a loyal customer at Magasin Cafe for years, it's what made me fall in love with Vietnamese food. Since Magasin Cafe has closerd for renovations I came to Magasin Kitcheb to curb my weekly pho cravings. The food and service were good- even the chopped was seasoned better than the other location. However, paying more money for the same meal and the restaurants atmosphere deters the ranking. Quality food and service will continue to keep me a loyal customer.
--------------------
This place has a few good things going for it: 

1. REALLY good gravy fries...seriously, if you haven't had them yet - you haven't lived
2. The staff here is friendly and entertaining! Don't let it alarm you if a waitress and a member of the kitchen staff randomly have a lover's quarrel...its all part of the character of the place! lol!
3. It is the perfect bar to watch ANY Philly sports team...but especially the Phillies. 
4. Pretty good beer selection, too!
--------------------
We tried these at the Collingswood Art Festival this weekend. they are a bit pricey, but worth it. The flavor is perfect. they aren't greasy. I will be seeking them out. Once you try them... you will want to have them again. they are a light cheddar curd, battered and friend. You don't taste grease or batter. the flavor of the cheese is delicious, and so stringy and melty. The sauces are a delicate compliment to the curd. Well worth the splurge.
--------------------
There are a ton of good sushi places in Reno and I have tried them all, but it always seems like Rickshaw has the freshest fish. I'm not a big fan of rolls and sauces, and opt mainly for Nigiri or sashimi. You can get some dressed up roll anywhere, hell you can buy them in the store, but if you are a true fan of sushi, just fish is where its at and Rickshaw has some of the freshest in town.
--------------------
What can I say?  I'm a sucker for new american.  The owner is a very nice gentleman who really enjoys food.  

The service was impeccable and the food was Ridiculously good.  We ordered a mixed berry waffle, huevo rancho, traditional breakfast bagel with grits, and best sandwich with fresh fruits.  

I highly recommend the huevo rancho and best sandwich.  The grits was very good as well. 

If you decide to visit this restaurant, say hi to the owner.  He's a great guy.
--------------------
Came for all-you-can-eat, and ended up waiting for over half an hour to get our order in. The servers completely ignored us, while taking orders from the tables around us. And on top of that, all of the rolls contain "extras" not listed on the menu. One roll surprised us by having sweet mustard sauce on it, which did NOT taste very good....
On the bright side, once we actually got our orders in they didn't take all that long to make them.
--------------------
These guys are awesome! Best burger restaurant in New Orleans. Service was on point, they made sure we had our food in a timely manner and food is fresh. We flew in from Atlanta, And this is the first place we went to. And we will definitely be back before we leave. 

My friends ordered the Gator burger and the deer burger. I personally ordered the buffalo wings, which was very good. We left super happy! Btw they're drinks are very good too!
--------------------
Great place to watch footy.  I was visiting town for work and needed a place to watch my blues take on barfalona and came across Chatham.  It was a Tuesday so they had $4 Guiness and Black and Tans. Had their fish and chips which was new experience for me. Never had fish that was so soft after being fried, but I really enjoyed it, almost the texture of a donut. Saw my team win and had a great time at this pub.
--------------------
We were early for church and wanted to grab a quick bite to eat. The atmosphere was really inviting and everyone on staff spoke to us at least once! 

The food was good, but not great. I had quiche and my guest had a croque madame. The crust of the quiche wasn't done and the bread on the croque wasn't that great. Otherwise these two dishes would have been perfect. The fruit was fresh and the coffee was great!

I will definitely return.
--------------------
Wonderful place, if you haven't checked it out!  Went there for a pizza making class.  Had a great time, learned some great techniques (thanks to John from Ornesto), and met some really great people.  This place is the Disneyland for bakers, chefs and wanna be chefs.  I already signed up for another class in January and I purchased several of their store goods.  Check it out.  It's a little hard to find, as the lighting is a little dim - or maybe it's me.  :-)
--------------------
Celebrating our honeymoon over New Years week, we were lucky enough to score a few nights at the historic Monteleone. I'll forever want to stay there when visiting New Orleans. The decor is lovely, the staff very accommodating (we received an upgrade), and the location is fantastic for exploring the city on foot. The rooftop pool is so awesome with really neat views. Our room had a beautiful and relaxing jacuzzi tub. I can't wait to convince my husband to bring me back!
--------------------
Planet fitness gets four stars just because it is open 24 hours. If you are looking at cheapest it's cheapest best bang for your buck . Not much motivation since bodybuilders don't go there much mostly big women . No pun intended . No discrimination I myself used to be big, although I changed that . 
Tanning bed and massage chairs and a sculpt machine and everything. Else for 20.00 a month . 9.99 - the massage and stuff and can't bring friends . All the employees are polite and helpful .
--------------------
The food is average. Drink specials are great but the place is rarely crowded. Last time I was there it was a Friday night at 10 pm. There were maybe 3 other parties at the bar. About 5 minutes after ordering our first drink, they announced it was last call...at 10:15 PM on a Friday night! Needless to say we left for a different bar in the area and have removed it from our options of places to go past 6 pm for drinks.
--------------------
Ordered an iced mocha  and an iced white chocolate mocha and they were both was awful.  They  had NO coffee flavor or chocolate flavor at all, very watered down.  Even went back and asked the girl to add another shot and why.  I think she remade them, instead of just adding another shot.  Still had NO flavor.  Not even sure how you could make it that bad.  We both ended up throwing them away on the way out.  So sad, not even worth drinking.
--------------------
It's a young start up company. Patience is a virtue.
Many in the gun community lack this virtue, so be it.
Owner seems to be a stand up guy and has stood by his word in my dealings with him.
I met the owner, Jacob, at a gun show in Las Vegas where I purchased a Cerakoted billet lower.
Pretty quality work on the machining and Cerakote job.
Traded emails with the owner and always got a quick response with the information I requested.
--------------------
Great food, awful service. I ordered online at 6:20, site said it would be ready at 6:40. I get there at 6:37 and i expected to wait a couple minutes but not the entire 20 minutes it takes to cook my food. They didn't even start cooking it till i got there. I leave at 7. They did nothing for the inconvenience and still made me pay full. Honestly, I'm so upset with how the whole situation was handled. Where is the customer service??
--------------------
Unless you have gray hair , are over 45 and appear wealthy , don't expect to get good service . My girlfriend and I sat there and witnessed our waitress cut up with many older couples in suits , then would check on us every half hour to 40 minutes , and didn't even check on our steaks and how they were prepared. The management never asked how our meal was ,(we witnessed them going table to table). VERY disappointed for spending $80, to get this poor of service .
--------------------
My dogs and i love this place!   Always try to go when they have sales going on.  They have a wide variety of toys and are pretty well stocked.  They even allow your pets to come in with you.  The staff is very caring and friendly.  Whenever I have a question about a certain product, they give me a great answer or find someone who knows more about it.  Even though it's a chain store, I feel like it's a nice neighborhood pet store.
--------------------
After my ROTD  yesterday of a different Sweet CeCe's location, I realized that I had never reviewed my local source!  Anyway, I love the product.  Love love love.  And I usually like their selection of toppings - good mix between healthy and not-so-healthy.  Sometimes the girls working there aren't really paying attention or are nowhere to be found.  Sometimes you have to remind them of their deals (like $5 Friday).  But I can't give it less than 4 stars because I just love it so much.
--------------------
People in this place are generally friendly, but do not make the mistake of going to Katie.  She went through my hair like a bulldozer-- slapped colour on it in less than 5 minutes and cut it in even less time.  I think she was in a rush to get out of there (it was late in the day), but then she shouldn't have agreed to take me on.  The whole thing cost me close to $200, and I was shaken up by the experience.
--------------------
There never seems to be a crowd at this Marsh store...getting in and out is always easy.  I agree with the other reviewer on the state of red baskets...ick.  Fix please!

I like that they opened up aisles so you don't have to walk all the way to one end to go to the next (prob happened a long time ago but I just noticed today).  And always seems like they are one cashier short here.

Very good selection of products (as always) from Marsh.
--------------------
I went to Spasso the other night with some friends. All four of us were SO pleased with our experience and our meals! We each had something different. I had the special for the evening, which was seafood (jumbo shrimp and jumbo lump crab) over pappardelle with tomato and asparagus. it was to die for, and my leftovers the next day were just as tasty :) service was amazing and wine was perfect. I live on state street and can't wait to visit again very soon!!
--------------------
i had the seafood combo-catfish (and im talkin like 5 pounds of it), red beans and rice and coleslaw.  the food was pretty damn good.  well, the real reason we walked in to this place was due to the big sign out front: "happy hour, mon-sat, 4pm-7pm, 2 for 1"  Now THAT is what im talkin about.  i ordered a margarita...and being that i'm from California, i have extremely high standards for marg's.  wasn't bad, but really wasn't great... but food made up for it!
--------------------
The crew at Bella Vista Designs are FABULOUS.  From start to finish, they are professional, conscientious, and innovative (and affordable!).  They never cease to amaze me with their can-do attitude and absolutely gorgeous and creative design. 

The events at Santa Barbara Historical Museum and Goleta Valley Historical Society that I produce attract generous donors and they always say the same thing when they see their work, "Wow!!"  

I can't thank them enough for the hundreds of successful events (and the many magical moments we've seen)!
--------------------
I recently had dinner here with my wife over the weekend and could not have been more pleased! 

Our meal was excellent! My wife and I were astounded by how quickly our food came out! Everything tasted fresh and homemade which we both appreciated. 

The only problem was trying to pick something from the menu as there were too many delicious sounding items to choose from. We will definitely be returning to try more items! Can't wait to see what the next chef specials will be!
--------------------
I had a horrible experience here. The waiter was great but as I got my appetizer, there was it has a hair in it.
Next the noodles came out mine was fine but my friend has a huge hair in his. I thought he was joking until he told me. After that it ruined my appetite, I gave the noodles back and they didn't even give me a new one, I thought I should've got the food for free at that point.. never eating here again
--------------------
Had a falafel wrap here a few years ago. Not bad, so tried it again today. No flavor, except extreme saltiness! The falafels & pita = no flavor. I was hoping the tzatziki sauce would pull it all together, nope! It had no flavor either. It wasn't like the sauce you'd imagine, but more like a thin tasteless glue. Only good part about the wrap were the fresh diced cucumber & tomato, too bad that was underneath the icky white sauce that doesn't even deserve to be called tzatziki : (
--------------------
Only giving a 1 because there is nothing lower!!! Angie
Gave me the worst haircut I've ever had!!! I came in with 2 photos of the cut I wanted came out with my hair looking NOTHING like the photos!!  Even when pointed out to her she didn't not pay attention to what she was doing.  Came out basically having a mans flattop!  Would never go to this place again!!! Nothing like going into the Holidays with a crappie haircut. Thank you!! Angie and Regis Hair salon!!
--------------------
Friday, July 22 we decided to give this eatery a try.  It is definitely in a great location especially if you want to explore the Quarter afterwards.  We were a party of 8 people and out of the 8 dishes ordered only 2 were really good --the jambalaya and file gumbo were very tasty.  The other dishes --red beans/rice,  meatloaf, Mac and cheese,  shrimp po boy, and chicken wings were bland and a waste of money.  The staff was nice but overall the food was mediocre.
--------------------
I first heard about this place on the plane ride over from a Franklin local.  He recommended that we brave the line and try one of Nashvilles best breakfast spots.  HE WAS RIGHT.  Holly cow this place kicked butt and we didn't even have to wait in line!! We were lucky to miss the rush said our waitress.   I had this super savory corn pancake with bacon, salsa, and sour cream. So good. This place will always be a stop when I get back to the south~~~
--------------------
Truly, I cannot say enough good things about this tiny, authentic, perfectly delicious eatery!  Growing up in the panhandle of Texas, we had plenty of authentic Mexican food in our home, and I'm always searching for good Mexican restaurants. El Limon is the best I've ever had in the state of Pennsylvania!  Sopes, tostadas, enchiladas, fajitas, burritos, fish tacos....all excellent and sooooo reasonable!  Waitstaff is always pleasant and attentive.  Best two features: homemade tamales and free margaritas!!  Bring the entire family for an amazing Mexican feast!  Ole!
--------------------
Hands down the worst chicken and rice plate I've ever had. When I ordered I was told there was no sauce on the chicken (as I wanted, healthy). I ordered to go, by the time I reached the car the bag was full of oil spilling out of the container. There was easily 5-7 tablespoons of oil on the dish. Not what I was told and not what anyone would ever want to eat. Horrible.   Their slogan even has the word healthy in it. What a joke.
--------------------
One of the best burgers in Philly!

Low key joint with just a few tables and the kitchen in the dining room. But, don't let the modest face fool you, this place rocks!

Menu is creative and fully customizable. Burgers are cooked on a flattop, perfectly seared, juicy, slightly charred. Fries are hand cut, fried fresh, perfectly crispy and salty. What more could you ask for from a burger place? 

Pro tip - Download the SPOT app for a rewards program and some good coupons (aka free fries!).
--------------------
Love it!! I go to this place whenever I am in town and have NEVER been disappointed. The food is organic, fresh and delicious. I love that they buy from local farmers and fishermen. They also grow a lot of their own veggies! You can't get much fresher than that. There's lots of variety so I haven't even come close to trying everything. My favorite breakfast item is Carly's breakfast. Avocado on sourdough toast with a fried egg and sweet potatoes. Sooo good! Highly recommend this place!
--------------------
Holy Mole!
That was good. 

Enjoyed a wonderful evening here as part of a Yelp Elite event. Got to sample a wide variety of their food, and each dish was better than the next. The cocktail -- created special for the event, I think -- was fantastic (and I'm not usually a cocktail kind of guy...). The manager and staff are as attentive, knowledgeable, and friendly as could be. 

Basically, I consider the whole event an enticing appetizer for a much-anticipated main course: coming back for a full meal!
--------------------
Pizza was so good! First time trying today and ordered online. A little mess up with their system so they didn't get my order in time. The guy called me back, told me he was making the pizza in a rush and wasn't charging me for it. 20 minutes later he came to the door himself with my Fresh, hot pizza and 2 brownies all for free. 
He was very apologetic. Customer service was fantastic and food was awesome. This is my new go to delivery joint.
--------------------
This is the place we have been searching for! My friend and I have tried several nail salons in Tampa and nobody could do designs and stuff like how we wanted so we found this place on Instagram and we will never go anywhere else again! We drive almost an hour to get here but it is so worth it! I have had 2 different people who both did exactly what I wanted and are extremely talented! Thank you Pamela and Steven! You all do amazing work!!!
--------------------
As an avid knitter, I try to find a local yarn store pretty much wherever I travel. I was delighted to discover that The Quarter Stitch was walking distance from my hotel AND they had a special Mardi Gras yarn in stock. I ended up visiting the store twice while I was in NOLA, once to grab the Mardi Gras yarn and a second time because their selection was just delectable. Added bonus, the staff was amazing and super helpful. I would definitely visit this store again.
--------------------
With all the talk of bbq tips, sweetie pie, etc of St. Louis...I decided to try this place after flying in. The customer service was great, they make their own BBQ sauce which is between a sweet, tangy with pinch of spice. It could be considered overpowering if not used to it. The pull pork sandwich was recommended along with beans and Cole slaw. Again, this could be too much for one who has never tried it and/or intake this type of food on a daily basis.
--------------------
I must admit, I wasn't expecting much. This place totally blew us away. This has to be one of the best Indian restaurants in the Tampa Bay. The ambience is wonderful including white table linens. The best part was the food, OMG. The chicken 65 was to die for, and the hot sour soup was rich and flavorful. The waitress (Angel) was friendly,  attentive and very pleasant. They opened just a week ago. I'm sure this will soon be the place foodies seek out for real Indian food.
--------------------
My parents and I took the Oak Alley and Laura Plantation tour on September 26th, 2015.  I forgot the name of our driver-he was very informative on our drive to the plantations.  The schedule is perfect!  We were dropped off where we had time before and after the tour for free time to walk around the properties.  They are very flexible with drop off locations on the return drive.  We got off near Jackson Square and got to enjoy the rest of the afternoon in the French Quarter.
--------------------
Good choice in Union Station St. Louis.  I had the Ponchartrain (server said it is same as Tilapia, though that was also on the menu, so why two names for the same fish, I have no clue).  The Ponchartrain was quite good with mushrooms and a cream sauce.  We also had the shrimp cocktail and lump crab cake appetizers....both fine, but not wonderful.  Drinks and service were perfectly acceptable.  We dined outside on the patio since the weather was nice - inside looks comfy and a bit less casual.
--------------------
Cinco de mayo means margaritas and sangria and all things fried... this great place does a nice job with combining flavors of several different ethnicities and backgrounds and develops recipes that are unique.  Although not touted as a "Mexican" destination they know how to rock the rock salt and pour that tequila.  They also just opened a wine bar a couple doors down for overflow and specialty bottles.  A high five for the on the rocks margaritas and house made white or red sangria - definitely worth the trip!
--------------------
Definitely get in line before 8:30am. We waited about 30 minutes. Pancakes were fine. My friends got the raspberry pancakes, the sweet potato pancakes and the san antonio. I got the sugar and spice pancakes. All were well and fine, a bit dry. I don't understand the hype, but if the line isn't too long it's not bad for normal breakfast food. If the line is longer I would highly recommend skipping this place and heading down the street to Fido - insanely good coffee and great breakfast food.
--------------------
I am sort of a sushi snob. 

I'm going to be honest. This was literally the worst sushi Ive ever had.  It was warm... WARM! (and NO! it wasn't tempura).

I also paid $3 for a side salad which was literally iceberg lettuce. 

Nope... no spring mix...no romaine...no iceberg with slivers of carrots or even purple cabbage... LITERALLY just iceberg. I was puzzled and then angry and then i had to smirk and whisper, "well played my friend... well played".

I will never be back..

Check and Mate.
--------------------
Incredible service and incredible food! The black bean ravioli is succulent! The bone-in steak was flavorful and amazingly juicy and delicious. And the best of all, service was perfect. From the friendly hostess to the waiter to the chef who personally came over to make sure we enjoyed our food, everyone really made us feel at home. 

As an added bonus, the ambiance is beautiful. Decor, lighting, and fireplace makes the place very homely. 

Highly recommended. I went as a group of four and had an excellent time.
--------------------
Our 1st visit here. We went through the drive thru & ordered 4 Chicago dogs. The total bill was $10.  The Chicago Dogs were great & the only place in a 28 mile radius that you can purchase one. The only 2 things missing were a poppyseed bun & celery salt. My last attempt for a Chicago dog locally was Sonic (yuck). SuperGyro uses 100% beef hot dogs, that neon green relish, sport peppers, onions, dill pickle tomatoes & onion. I'll be back for more & also to try the other menu items.
--------------------
Second time's the charm. Stopped by once to have a duplicate key made only to find that their hours were not at my convenience. My bad I guess. Stopped by a second time a week or so later - (it's close to home, so why now swing by?) - this time they were open and they proved to be very helpful.

Pleasant encounter with the gentleman behind the counter who quickly cut several odd-shaped keys for me that the big box stores could not duplicate.

Quick, polite, efficient, and cost-effective.
--------------------
This is hands down my favorite brewery in The world!! My husband is from STL and every time we go back to visit his family we visit the brewery! Most recently, we didn't"Beer School" with some of our friends and it was AWESOME!! I would definitely recommend it! & if it's your first time visit do the Brewery tour first because seeing the Clydesdales and the ends and outs of this brewery was amazing!!! I can't wait to go back and do the "Brew Master"!! Until next time, Budweiser!
--------------------
Still running on EST, we arrived @8:30 on a Saturday to find no wait to be seated OR helped, ordering up the sweet potato pancakes with cinnamon cream syrup (good topped with excellent) with some borderline awful hash browns (really, people??). Can't say I'd return even without a wait, though; would prefer to just buy a jar of the syrup and apply it at home. Ended up at $24.43 pre-tip; no paper towels in the restroom and the day had barely started, so that was probably a dogshow.
--------------------
In my book you can never go wrong having a good old-fashioned meal a Johnny Rockets. I had their recent promo which was a barbecued pulled pork burger. It was a lot of food and a lot of flavor!! Top that with endless fries and I'm a happy camper. Have never had a bad experience at this location. They were recently moved from the casino floor level to the shopping level and since they did that they don't do the singing or dancing anymore which is a shame
--------------------
Made reservation a over a week ago with request to be near band. On arrival they had no record of it. And we are stuck in the back next to the bathroom. 5 stars for cocktail,food, band and Atmosphere. 1 stars for utter lack of organization.  The woman who took it said she was new. Always call to confirm I guess. Completely disappointed esp since we've had such amazing experiences here in the past.  There open tables near front and were told they were for people with reservations
--------------------
I've been here for several blow outs and I highly recommend! The entire staff is talented and I love how you can book online. I usually see Krissy or Bianca, but everyone is great and super friendly. I also recommend getting a vital shot with your blow out. It is a deep conditioning product that doesn't add extra time to your visit but makes all the difference! I am blonde so I am always trying to keep my hair conditioned, and the vital shot lasts about a week!
--------------------
REALLY below average food.  Akin to waffle house.  I wanted this to be good based on the reviews but not so.  The pancakes tasted like a frozen processed version, "homemade" maple syrup was watery/sugary with fake flavoring.  Trees make authentic syrup, not people.  The hash browns were greasy and fairly tasteless. The bacon overcooked, hard and chewy.  Obviously had been sitting awhile. Overall, very uninspired food.  Unfortunately, this is one of those places that is living on an outdated "must go" reputation.  There are much better offerings in Nashville.
--------------------
This place is amazing! The pizza cookies are a must. It came hot, soft, and crazy delicious. 

We tried the Peanut butter pizza cookie and the Oreo cookies, and both were perfection. I'm very eager to try other flavors. Also, being open until 3am is the smartest decision of any bakery in America. 

The only reason I'm not giving a 5 is because of the prices. But, to be honest, those late nights when all I want is a fresh baked cookie pizza, I'd be willing to pay $50.
--------------------
Visited the preserve today based on reviews and was VERY pleased.  

The hikes are great! Lots of wildlife and nature to see on clearly marked paths. 
The birds of prey aviary is wonderful and the learning center not only presents educational information in a beautiful manner, but the AC was a nice break after the hike.  

If you make your way over in the mid afternoon you may be lucky enough to see the birds up close with the handlers. 

All the staff and volunteers are friendly and helpful.
--------------------
Stopped in on a Monday around 7pm and the place was pretty full.  The bartender was friendly and attentive.  The bar seemed well stocked, not a drinker so take that as you will.  Now the food...THE FOOD was fantastic!  I ordered the Pear Gorgonzola Melt.  How they fit all that amazingness on one plate is impressive.  The clientele is all ages and backgrounds, which is great.

Nutshell:  Definitely check this place out for a good sandwich at a good price (~$10) and to catch up on the footy games.
--------------------
I have new dental insurance and had to find a dentist in network and came across Music City Dental. Dr. Spurlin and her staff are great! They are very gentle and make sure the patient is comfortable at all times. I had to get a filling and am terrified of shots. I didn't even feel when Dr. Spurlin gave me my shot. I was offered a pillow, blanket and choice of watching a movie or listening to music. I had a pleasant experience and am definitely a permanent patient!
--------------------
We were vacationing in the French Quarter for a few days and stumbled into Flanagan's Pub.  Our first stop was about 11am and there were just a few people, probably regulars by how the bartender greeted them.  We loved the place so much that we ended back in there 3 times in one day!

We talked with the bartenders, locals and tourists all just hanging out having a nice drink and listening to some punk rock music.  It was a nice change from the over-the-top bars on Bourbon St.
--------------------
The Honey Apple grilled cheese sandwich is totally to die for! I never been more happy to eat a grilled cheese sandwich in my life! The staff is friendly, the decor is cool and hip, and the food is great. The Meltdown in Montgomeryville does not compare. The service is rude and the decor is too futuristic/weird. I had my server throw my sandwich at me and splash another customer with soup at Montgomeryville. Regardless of then other shops, I love meltdown it really helps a cheese lover out!
--------------------
Went to Three Muses our first night in New Orleans. The plates are tapas style, small and meant for sharing. Between the four of us we got the blue cheese stuffed dates, the crawfish egg rolls, steak and cake, lamb sliders, feta fries and fish tacos. Everything was really good,i could have done without the tacos, but the lamb sliders and the steak and cake were AMAZING. The goat cheese paired with the lamb was to die for. And the crab cake was the best I have ever had.
--------------------
I was a little nervous since this is my first time with LF and I didn't know what to expect. Tori was such a sweetheart. I showed her picture of the hairstyle I wanted, and she turned it into reality! At the end of my visit, she wrote down the products that she used. She also gave me some great suggestions about treating my hair type (fine & thin). The place was clean and modern. Parking was not an issue and I came on Saturday. It was a great experience!
--------------------
WOW!! What A burger, terrific flavor. Well cooked very well seasoned and a healthy portion of sides with it as well. We had homemade potato chips and waffle fries sweet potatoes.  
The outside patio was great, just wish there was a law against smoking ANYWHERE people could eat! 
Out waiter Jesse was jam up and took good care of us! 
This place came on a recommendation from a friend and is off the beaten path just a bit but worth every single moment and delicious place and will return
--------------------
Really liked this store yesterday. Great selection, I was impressed by Chloe and Marc Jacobs items and Chanel pumps for $87 (too small for me=(
I found their price range great (now they have summer sales on) but in general you get great value for money. I am not looking for $20-30 T Shirts, I am ready to pay $100 for a silky blouse (which can retail for $300+) so I guess this will be my go-to store. 
And! the lady at the store was super friendly and nice.
--------------------
I stopped by Mel's for a late lunch and got the turkey club.  The cook/waiter greeted me with a big smile and served me one of the best turkey club sandwiches I've ever had.  It was chuck full of fresh turkey on delicious multi-grain toast. While I was there, the cook took a pork roast out of the oven for the next day's sandwiches and it looked and smelled like heaven. I can't wait to go back to try a pork sandwich and to go for breakfast as well.
--------------------
It's been a few years since I've been here. I was impressed that they had little tvs in the exam rooms for the patients. Now I realize 1. you can't really watch tv during dental work and 2. maybe it's a "perk" since the prices are so high.

I originally went to get a cleaning/exam but was told I needed several inlays which, of course, weren't covered by insurance and were very expensive. The dental work was done well(no complaints there) but it's very expensive and was possibly unnecessary.
--------------------
This is the first time I tried this place and  I was surprisingly surprised. I had a combination dinner pad Thai and coconut soup. The soup was very tasty as I never had coconut soup before. The pad Thai was exactly what I was expecting and it did not disappoint. The restaurant had great Thai decor and music. The staff and service was top notch. For a town with not much selection for food, this was a great change of pace. This may become my go to place in Carp.
--------------------
My friend and I came here around 2pm on a Monday. It happened by default, as most of the restaurants on Main Street were closed. We sat ourselves down at the bar and got to drinking. After a few drinks, I ordered the pulled pork tacos and my friend had a burrito. Not bad, not stellar. Just a standard very place to drink and eat Mexican food. It's got a very college feel even in the middle of the day, so keep that in mind if that's not your thing.
--------------------
I am sort of a simple man, so I had never been to a liquor bar before. I have been to The Libertine twice and had a good experience both times. They use fresh ingredients all the way down to the crushed ice, which they crush with a mallet right at the bar. 

The biggest problem I ran into was figuring out which restroom was the men's. You have to look at the hair on the dimly lit pictures that indicate which is which, all the faces look the same.
--------------------
If I could give half a star I would, I'm from Tx, and anyone that thinks this is BBQ, I am willing to apologize to you for being led to believe that this is what BBQ is like.
I ordered the sample platter, horrific, the chicken looked and tasted like frozen pressed meat, the ribs.... All cartilage, the sausage, bland.... The sauce.... Walmart basic sauce with cups of sugar thrown in.... Extremely overpriced for ummm.... A child's plate (what it seemed like). I would never recommend this place to anyone.
--------------------
This was mine and my fiancé's first time eating here because it not only just opened up, but I got a coupon for a free pizza, so why not right?

We weren't blown away with the experience or the pizza, but liked that it was fast and efficient. The staff that made that pizza was very friendly, but the cashier wasn't sharing that same enthusiasm. 

Wouldn't drive out of my way to go here, but if we are in the neighborhood and feel like some pizza, we may go back.
--------------------
To sum it up, it's an average bar with ties to a very well-known TV show - but that fact doesn't make the food or much else better. When I went they had $4 White Rascal's and on top of that I had the normal gravy fries. $11 for fries, steep to say the least. They were steak fries, covered in gravy and mozzarella cheese and while pretty damn good, I would be hesitant to say that they're worth the price. Service was good, sometimes a little slow, but still friendly.
--------------------
Probably the best coffee shop I've ever been to. Everything they make is great. Their pure black and draft latte are the best iced coffee drinks I've ever had, full stop. Their drip and espresso are also very tasty and strong. If you are in the area and love coffee you need to stop by this spot. 

Only complaint: the line can get absurdly long. However, the staff here is some of the best around and the line moves very quickly. On that note, service here is also very friendly.
--------------------
I love Skyline Chili.  I first had this stuff in Cincinnati, and I was thrilled to when a location opened in Clearwater. 

This particular Skyline, however, is not great.  The service is generally poor, and the food comes out very slowly.   It seems like every time that I go, they are "out" of something, or some equipment isn't working.  Sometimes it's baked potatoes, sometimes it is french fries, sometimes it is something else.

Love the cheese coney hot dogs all the way!

I hope this location can get their act together.
--------------------
I deducted one star because the service was not great. Our waiter wasn't friendly at all. The first question was "soup or salad ". I wanted to order appetizer and lunch special, but he assumed we were having lunch. Seaweed salad was really good. Shiomay was small but good. The sashimi was fresh. Banzai roll was great and unique. Raw salmon and white fish with avocado and fish egg wrapped in cucumber with some sweet sauce. Perfect for those who is looking for no-rice roll. Salad dressing was more like carrot purée.
--------------------
Our second favorite place to watch a sunset. It's way north of Tampa, so a bit of a drive. We love to join everyone to clap when the sun goes down...a wonderful way to end the day. 

The music is lively, as are the patrons. Don't expect to swim in the water, it's a rocky beach, not much sand. Have been taking our boys since they were babies...are fifteen now. The food and drinks don't make an impression either way, it's the view and atmosphere that draws you in. 

Never disappoints.
--------------------
O! Wings has the best wings!! Hot momma and the original for the win!! Oh! And the bulgogi wrap. My dad, who's very picky, even praised the wings and wrap! 

Their service and attitude is very very friendly and accommodating. 

I phoned in a to go order originally for 6 people. Later half an hour before the pick up time, I added 10 more entrees. They were very very accommodating and had me ready to go and out the door in 15 minutes! 

Yumm! Can't wait to go back for more!
--------------------
Came in after attending the Zurich Classic golf tournament. It was a warm and a bit humid so what tastier then a ice cream cone? I lucked out and found a parking space on the street. The interior is quite cute and comfy.

The selection here is crazy huge but after sampling a couple of unusual flavors I went with the scoop of cookie monster ice cream on a cone. The ice cream hit the spot and I enjoyed it BC it wasn't overly sweet.

Creole Creamery was definitely worth checking out!
--------------------
There is a great selection of whiskey/bourbon to suit anyone's taste. We had burgers with the fried egg on it and it was soo good and probably one of the best burgers I've ever had. The duck fries are a MUST if you come here. It is a cute atmosphere although we went with a party of 4 and it was a tad awkward the way our seating was and made it difficult to have conversation with everyone at our table. Overall, a nice place to go. We will be going back.
--------------------
First off, it is a bar through and through. The alcohol selection is good and the drinks well mixed. It is also a casino bar, so you'll be paying higher than average prices. There is a small food menu, but the selection isn't that great. To add insult to injury the food made me ill. The reviews about service aren't exaggerations. We, too, practically had to tackle our server to order food and drinks many of times. Not my preferred place to go when there are so many better options in Reno.
--------------------
Horrible experience, pizza was soggy and cold when I received it, took 2 hours until I actually received my order as well. Absolutely no communication on my order, even after calling twice. Once I finally received the pizza I called to get my money back, which was communicated that I would not be charged, soon to find out that I was charged the very next day. I highly recommend never ordering from here, service was horrible and they were extremely rude. I won't be ordering from here again and either should you.
--------------------
I absolutely love this place and think is easily the best burrito shop in town. Great salsas, relaxed atmosphere, excellent service and price,  Most importantly the burritos are delicious. The chicken and chorizo combo is  my personal favorite but the smoked brisket is great as well. The medium burrito is plenty unless you are training for an eating event.  Family owned, not a chain and it shows in the attention to flavor. Highest recommendation if you are interested in good, healthy food (unless you eat yourself into oblivion) at a reasonable price.
--------------------
We ate at the bar on a Friday night, where the extremely charming bartender made us the best Manhattans I've ever had, using Carpano Antica Formula vermouth.  We ordered the lamb meatballs, which were okay, and the spring rolls, which were excellent. 

This is a perfect place to stop for a drink in the Quarter, if you need a nice civilized break.  The drinks were extremely expensive, but well worth it for the occasional night out.

The manager, Eric, could not have been more professional and friendly.  We will definitely go back.
--------------------
Enjoyed a company corporate holiday party with 2K+ people in the Tuscany Ballroom with an overnight stay in the Tuscan Tower.  By far the very best resort in the area delivering a cruise ship like first class experience.  I don't smoke and didn't notice the typical second hand casino smoke.    

Bonus was eating breakfast in the coffee shop with the Peppermill CEO/GM John Hanson pulling up a seat next to me at the counter engaging in friendly conversation about my stay while enjoying his breakfast.   Doesn't get much better than this folks.
--------------------
Cute interior and owner (?) gave us tour of upcoming patio/rooftop area which will be great on beautiful days like today. Cheese curds were very good and very filling. Really like that sandwiches come w salad, esp after eating too many curds! Had the onion, gruyere, tomato sandwich. Wasn't too much cheese which I liked. Needed something else...pepper jelly maybe. Would like to see more menu options added such as salads w fun cheeses. Lots of beer and wine as well as limited cocktails. Next time I will try one of the draft wines.
--------------------
I at least have to give this restaurant two stars due to the decent food. But while on a dinner meeting and after spending $100 on entrées and appetizers, I had to flag down the assistant cook, (the guy in bright red baggy pants watching TV), to see if I could get more avocado for my tuna entrée.  He made it very apparent and direct that he could not help me with that situation and I would have to flag down my  waitress so she could bill me for the four dollar avocado.
--------------------
I've been coming to this place for years now, and even though I now live in Colorado, I come back here every time I'm in Philadelphia for work (which is often). I've tried many items on the menu and many were great, portions are generous, and prices are low. My go to item - Indian Mee Goreng, I can eat that every day of the week if I could, it's that good. Maybe one day I can get the recipe from the manager so I can actually do that on days I'm in CO.
--------------------
Another Yelper hit it -- this is a noisy, crowded restaurant with big screen TVs.  I wouldn't call it a sports bar.  Nothing wrong with the place.  Cool location, good beer selection.  The food - delicious, but eliminates itself as a "sports bar". My sons and I wanted to catch some pub grub and the hockey game.  Got the game.  The grub-- eclectic.  Do go here if you want a busy, bustling, energetic, tasty, flavorful, thumping music-beat experience.  Don't go here if you want  a burger, a beer and a hockey game amidst sports conversation.
--------------------
I loved the atmosphere here. It was quiet, but not too quiet. The waiters and waitresses made casual conversation, but still checked to see that the customers were satisfied. It's a small place, but there seems to be plenty of room. Everyone that worked there was friendly and happy to help. The food was also delicious. I had the Crabby Wife, which I'd definitely recommend (with fried eggs) while my boyfriend had the chicken & waffles (get it with hot-sauce, syrup, and the sauce they provide you - it was fantastic!). Overall, it was great.
--------------------
Four of us had dinner at the Sockeye Grill this weekend.  Service was terrible.  Super slow.  Salads were warm and tasteless.  Dressing was watered down. 

Salmon was excellent.  Nachos were okay. Finger steaks were mushy and drab. 

Waitress  knew her beer. The dark lager was excellent.  The lighter beers we had were too warm. 

Looks like this restaurant need some fine tuning.  The atmosphere was like a warehouse, more like being in a barn than a restaurant. 

Tvs everywhere but the news was on. Huh? How depressing is that? 

We won't be back.
--------------------
I am such a big fan of DSW but for some reason I don't care much for this one.  I mean it is decent, but when I went to the one in Marlton 2 days later, I found even more shoes I liked and even better quality in the clearance section.  I was kind of upset by the new layout because it actually feels more like a warehouse when I never got that feel before.  Not many people asked if I needed help or even paid me much attention which was annoying too
--------------------
This is a convenience store deli, so don't expect a neat restaurant setting or drink service (that's the only reason I give 4 stars instead of 5). I've had a Cuban press one time, and a breakfast sandwich at another time. Sandwiches are prepared upon your order and I was very happy with the food. Delicious! There are some tables inside and some outside on the dock, overlooking ocean. There is a more popular breakfast place (Maggie Mae's) in the same strip mall but taste-wise I must say I like this deli much better.
--------------------
Hate to be harsh but dang! After having a limited selection at terminal F I finally decided to go with Tony Luke's. I was looking forward in trying there Philly Cheese Steak been in Philly and all. So I unraveled the sandwich and to no surprise the sandwich I got didn't look nothing like the picture on the overhead display of the sandwich. The part that got me even more was the meat. I don't know what it taste like to eat dog food, but I am sure I just paid $10 for it.
--------------------
was here twice -- first for a nightcap at the bar -- the drinks really were some good stuff and i tried a the lemon hummus and pita -- that was the best hummus ive ever had!

the next morning we came in for brunch, which was pretty much terrible. first of all, it took us 45 minutes to get our food for brunch....and it came out cold and we found a hair. the manager did comp our check though. overall, the bar is great, but i would skip breakfast. what a disappointment for a kimpton restaurant.
--------------------
This amazing brick oven pizza joint gets better every time I go. The last I time I went I got a Rotolo and a prosciutto pizza. The Rotolo is dough wrapped around mortadella and ricotta cheese and topped with pistachios and oil. It is so good. I order it every time. It's about the size of a bun and cost $5. The pizza was amazing. The prosciutto was incredibly tasty. The dough is divine. The service is always great and the beer selection is good. Definitely one of the best pizza places in Philly.
--------------------
This is my favourite place to get fish tacos! It's all I ever order, along with the occasional queso or beans which are also delicious. My friend was visiting from out of town and he ordered the beef taco and chicken fajitas and thought they were pretty average. However, he agreed that the fish tacos were amazing. Since 2 full me up and they're only like $2.60 each it's a pretty happy visit all round for me! Plus the interior and patio are awesome
(And there's Ben and Jerry's right next door for dessert)
--------------------
Tyson is on point, sharp and follows through on his word. I brought an RV with a ford front end to him not only did he get me in right away but he finished ahead of time. Parts were ordered and in shop and the guys were working on it next day. I had my RV bumper replaced on the ford front end in 3 days and back on the road. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED! Only place I will take my vehicles, as a business owner it's important for great service. Manny and Tyson are great!
--------------------
So I hear whispers of a reemergence of brunch I truly believe this is the best brunch spot in New Orleans.  And they only do it once a year. Great local favors. Great service Their so called biscuits and debris should be called the "life changing flavorgasm" at that moment when you realize simplicity and perfection collide; dazed and confused you will awaken your senses at Carrollton market. The oyster good enough French omelet is everything I wanted in life and more. Thank you @Carrolltonmarket I am speechless. And that does not happen often
--------------------
Warning, if you come here on a Sunday there is a set tasting menu.  We were a party of two, they served us with one plate, "family style".  The only problem is the woman next to us was a party of one and had the same size servings.  They are claiming family style but giving the same portions they give to one person to multiple people. My advice, make sure you request being served as one person with separate plates.  The food was delicious but the business aspect was unacceptable.  Will not come back.
--------------------
Have been here many times and always had a great experience. When we moved to Rita Ranch 6 months ago my husband and I did a lot of rehab work on our new house and would go almost once a week to recover from the week's "work-out". It's always clean, they never gyp you on time, take the time to work on problem areas. Felicia is the best. Highly recommend them! 

Update...neck really bothering me so I went in and had the best therapeutic massage with Felicia. It was amazing! She is truly talented.
--------------------
This place should be on Restaurant Impossible. It's run down, the decor is tacky, beaten up, miss-matched and cheap. It's really dark...probably to hide how dingy it is. Everything was sticky. I ordered a burger medium and got a charred, tasteless hockey puck. My mom and aunt got the baked crab soup, which before we ordered, we misheard each other and called it baked crap soup. It turned out to be a better description. The crab stuffed mushrooms were heavy on the stuff and light on the crab.  The servers were super nice though.
--------------------
I just started going to Sushi Nara this month (they opened just a short time ago).  I love this place; it is clean, the staff are friendly and acommodating, and the service is fast.  The sushi is always delicious ((I've been here 3 times) and the prices are reasonable. In fact, this week my husband stopped in for take out, bought 4 sushi rolls and the total was $24.  That is amazing.  

I love the freshness of the food and there's a huge selection to choose from.

Everyone on the eastside, check this place out!
--------------------
We ran in for a late night dinner last night. The prices are definitely high. Both couples decided to split a plate (you could tell the annoyed our server), and the food was good- but not worth the price for sure.
I will say the garlic bread they bring out before the meal was AH-MAZING! I could have probably eaten my weight in just the bread. 

Overall - I probably wouldn't eat there again myself. But it could have been an off night. There is just too much competition in the food world around St Louis!
--------------------
This is a small hole in the wall in the African section of Woodland Avenue.  Though it might not look like much, there is some good food coming out of its kitchen representing Senegal and West Africa.  I enjoyed the national dish of Senegal - Thiboudienne - although note that here they do a version without the usual tomato sauce.  I also took home a Jollof Rice which is often called the mother dish of Jambalaya.  There are a few hightop tables inside for dining or you can order the food to-go.  Either way, service is friendly.
--------------------
Wow. I am not a vegetarian, nor am I a health-food nut (except for my random "diet" binges) but this place is awesome. A co-worker talked me into trying it out one day (by going there and getting me something and putting it in front of me) and she created a monster. I may not order every day but I sure do think about them. And their delicious salads! Every time I go there I am greeted with a smile and there are tons of other people waiting for their food, as well. Good company =)
--------------------
We had dinner at Convivio right after it opened and we will definitely go back. There were a few minor quirks with the service and with wine being out of stock, but I'm chalking it up to the fact that it just opened and they were working out the kinks. The owner visited our table and he could not have been nicer or more gracious. The food was excellent...nothing to change there! I had the tortelloni pansotti, and i think it was the best pasta I've ever had. I'm sure we will be frequent diners .
--------------------
The beef noodles was a bit too salty and the fried rice was a bit oily. But overall they are good. We liked the shrimp spring rolls a lot. It is one of the best we have tried. 

The place could have earned higher points. But I have to give it a three stars because of the chaotic seating arrangement. The owner gave tables to people behind us despite we reminded the him and the staff. Perhaps that is what you get when you go to a teeny tiny Chinese restaurant during a long weekend.
--------------------
Quite possibly the perfect business model to fail if it wasn't for a sequestered clientel?  We visit New Orleans often, and it is an activity of ours to bet on how many beers or ingredients they are out of.  Bartenders rude and swearing. It's almost comical, we sit and listen to patrons asking for draft beers and mixed drinks and getting responses "can't do that".  They said "No mules", to at least 5 people as we sat for about 30 mins today.  2 out of 4 taps not working. What an absolute waste of opportunity.
--------------------
Went here with my boyfriend and we loved it!
Old school feeling, with 3 floors!!

We have been here twice, and each time was great!
The food was amazing, I got the veal since it had been recommended to me, as well as the clams casino, mussles, pasta with oil and garlic, and the home-made garlic bread. Staff was nice and helpful!

...Went here again recently while in the area and had this new dish of gnocchi with gorgonzola sauce in it, and it was delicious!!!!! My new favorite dish as this place. 

MUST EAT!!!
--------------------
Oh my goodness if you ever want to start on a health "trip" this is the place to start. They have so many different vitamins (hence the name), healthy dietary supplements, beauty products and homeopathic items as well. The staff was super helpful in assisting me find some of the items i needed to make my very own moisturizer. They helped me locate the items they had and provided suggestions for items they did not have. They also have a rewards program for frequent shoppers - LOVE THAT! And they accept digital coupons- LOVE THAT TOO!
--------------------
If you want stunning and unique pieces of jewelry, this is the place for it! The two marvelous owners, Ali and Albisia, are such sweet people. They create amazing jewelry that you really will have a hard time choosing from! I have a necklace, two bracelets, and a ring and am already hankering for more... There's also great music to add to the decor and general ambience of the store... and you get offered wine as you peruse! What can be better than that? 

Hope to visit Tampa again soon and see you guys soon!! :)
--------------------
Some of the fare on offer at That BBQ Place is wildly overpriced, especially given the fact that real cutlery, proper table service, and glassware are all missing.  While this place is as neat as a pin and while it offers very friendly service, I'm unlikely to return.  It won't matter, though, for it's busy enough that my custom is unlikely to be missed.  Their ribs still lack bark and they remain too moist for my liking.  In the end, Sherwood Parkers seem to like the place and that's all that matters for the owners.
--------------------
I have been a fan of Charlie's for many years and I recently came back because I didn't have any jeans that fit.  I'm so happy I came back.

The girl who helped me was extremely attentive.  She pulled about 20 different pairs for me to try and explained all the nuances in the different fits and washes.  She was very patient despite my incredible indecision.  I ended up purchasing two pairs of Sebastian McCalls and I am really happy that I discovered this brand.  They are super cute and comfortable.  I love this place!
--------------------
This is a must try, we come here frequent and we are never disappointed. Get there early so you get right in and don't have to wait. Decent selection of coffees, they have french press as well. Menu isn't huge which is nice so you can figure out what you want quickly. Food comes how in a decent time. I seem to always get the same thing (wilburt skillet) everytime I go cause it is amazing. Food just seems so fresh as well, friendly staff. You will leave full and a smile on your face.

Recently had my car tinted by Orange Tint and Tune and had fantastic service.  They offer a car pick up service if you live within 4 miles of their shop which is extremely convenient.  Carlos was my technician and went over all the tint options with me and even adjusted the grade of the tint after I expressed the look that I was trying to achieve.  That's the kind of customer care that deserves 5 stars.  In addition, the receptionist was very pleasant and the owner Dustin even followed up to see how my service was.
--------------------
I stopped in for dinner and a drink & was thoroughly pleased! I rarely order a burger when I go out to eat, because why order "out" what you can make easily a home, right? Well..... when I go back I'll have a hard time NOT getting another burger. Oh, they also have a decent beer selection and the wait staff/bartenders made me feel very welcomed too.  My food was prepared exactly as I ordered and was served quickly.  The restaurant has a nice atmosphere and the restrooms were clean.  All in all I was very happy!

Had dinner Saturday night for the first time at rusty pelican. Called ahead and made a reservation and requested a table next to the window overlooking the water. Hostess went to seat us away from the window, when we questioned her she huffed off and left us staying in the middle of the dining room!! She did return and sat us by the window. The rest of the evening was great, drinks, food and wait staff was excellent. Liz was our server and went above and beyond. Still have to say the hostess was very disappointing!
--------------------
I stopped in because I was hungry for some snacks.  Browsed the store since I had some spare time and found it to be clean and well stocked.  Wide isles, good selection of bakery stuff, flowers and all your usual groceries. I like that they had some locally made snacks too like California Kettle Corn and Taco Works (out of SLO).  Found the semi-unusual chips I wanted that other stores don't always carry, grabbed a Diet Coke by the checkout and I was happy.  Convenient parking lot and the staff was friendly and helpful.  Thanks Albertsons!

Similar experience at this place ..gelato is great...service sucks.a friend from out of town came to visit and we decided it would be cool to go here since they never had gelato..boy what a mistake..day staff cool..night staff not so much..they acted like we were an annoyance then a customer then whispering and laughing ..made my friend feels uncomfortable..so the young manager pops out from the back and I'm thinking cool though s guy will make them act more respectable,again wrong..he actually joined in.this place had great service not even a year ago..don't know what happened
--------------------
Great place to stay if you want to be on Bourbon street.  The staff is really hospitable and didn't fail me on food choices.  The room is nice and big.  However, I stayed in room 263 and thought it was perfect because it was not a room that faced Conti.  I was wrong because it was closer to the vending and ice machines.  The door/wall was thin enough that I heard conversations in the hall next to the vending machines.

I would have rated the hotel with 4 stars if it wasn't for the thin walls.
--------------------
Love love love this place for HH n dinner is good too! Its ok for brunch, not as great as what people praise it to be. The Asian Nachos are the dish to get for HH. Its an entree itself! The other HH dishes are great too. The creme brulee is amazing as with their other desserts. The blueberry mojito is awesome along with the mango sling. Great place to celebrate birthdays and such.  Nice feel to it. Bar area gets crowded as it gets later for HH. As usual around the mall, finding parking sux!
--------------------
We had several quotes, with Pete and Ron's being the best of those I considered reputable. When i told Arbour Bay I was going with Pete and Ron they told me I would be in good hands. Had 2 very large oaks, one inaccessible from the front yard, one less than 2 feet from my roof edge taken down with a crane. I left for work in the A.M. and when I got home at 4 the trees were gone. Minimal damage from the heavy equipment in my yard. Will definitely recommend to friends and neighbors.
--------------------
Had a party of 6 here for hibachi. Our waitress brought our separate sushi orders on one plate so we couldn't really tell who's was who's and forgot several items on an order. I understand making mistakes but the restaraunt was really quiet so we were kind of surprised. Usually hibachi is a fun lively experience and our  cook  said maybe three words, but he cooked very well his name was Francisco. Service was fishy, food was pretty good, and im hoping it was just an off night here. But for the money I wouldn't go back.
--------------------
Last night we tried to get into the oldest Italian Restaurant in South Philly. Thankfully, they couldn't fit us in, so our son said lets try Angelina's  so we walked around the corner and into a small Italian Restaurant.  Immediatly we felt at home.  Angelina is cooking in the front of the resaurant and her husband is servicing. There were 3 of us and we started off with Eggplant and roasted pepper appetizer.  One bite and we were hooked.  We ordered the Veal Osso Bocca, Carbonara and lasagna.  Everything was absolutly DELISH!!  Can't wait to go back!!!
--------------------
By far some of the most comfy theater recliners. My only complaint is that you have to put your feet down if someone wants to pass by you on the aisle. The bartender at the little lounge next to the theaters is a delight. And being able to drink in the theater is a nice plus. The drawback comes with concessions. At a peak time on a Saturday, there were 5-6 employees at the counter but utter disorganization and no hustle whatsoever. The popcorn was also burnt. Next time I'll eat beforehand and stick with the bar.
--------------------
A nice alternative to Cafe du Monde, the beignets were as good if not better. But the real kicker was NO line! 

It was a calm little oasis on Bourbon St. Granted at 8:30 am the street is empty besides garbage men & street washers.

We were there early on a holiday, so we didn't get to experience any live music, sadly.

We did have a full breakfast as well, sharing a crawfish omelet & Cajun hashbrowns. Neither was anything to write home about, but really when your name has Beignet in it, does the other stuff really matter?
--------------------
This review is for their lunch menu as I have not tried their other offerings yet. If you are lucky enough to have lunch there during their 11-2 sandwich times, you are in for a real treat! The two sandwiches I have tried (the grinder and the southwesterner) were absolutely delicious! There wasn't a single taste bud that wasn't satisfied. It is pricey and sandwiches are a little on the small side but it is well worth it. 

Can't wait to try (afford) their steaks!!

Food: 5/5
Service: 5/5
Price: 4/5 - A little high but great quality
--------------------
Great location, great food, and friendly staff! There are only a few seats and the store gets pretty crowded with people waiting for their food. I saw a lot of online order ready to go at the counter and think that would be the smart move the next time I want to come during a weekday lunch rush. Weather permitting, it's great to grab some HCV and eat it in Rittenhouse Square across the street! I've come a few times with friends and coworkers and no one has complained about their choices (vegetarians and meat eaters alike)!
--------------------
Went to ocharleys on a Sunday afternoon, it wasn't too busy but I guess our server was overwhelmed. He forgot our bread and butter. Forgot my fries multiple times, I was halfway done with my sandwich when my fries finally arrived. We got my son Sprite refilled at the bar after waiting so long for our waiter. We had a coupon that we told the server to add to our bill. Well he forgot to ring it up correctly, he got the manager to fix it. I might give ocharleys another try for lunch instead of dinner.
--------------------
My wife and I just moved to town and where saddened to have to move away from our local beloved Mexican restaurant.  We passed by this place several times knowing that once we moved in we would have to try it.  And OMG we where floored, the restaurant had great traditional ambiance and the service was top knotch.  They served glass bottle sodas which personally is something I love.  The food was amazing, my wife had the Taco Sombrero and I had the Chimichanga.  Both where amazing.  This place is 6 stars if I could give it.
--------------------
I love this food truck. They have the tastiest street foods like their captain crunch tilapia burrito. Who would've thought of that? The fried fish is so flakey and delicious, paired with fresh cabbage, tomatoes, avocado and Sriracha mayo. I have also tried their katsu and curry chicken which are so rich in flavor. Their Thai tea is also on point! So much to offer from a small food truck. I live in Jersey and I have driven here many times just to get food. They are so friendly and provide great food at a great price.
--------------------
This is as close to Japanese cuisine I get! I'm not a big fan of sushi, sashimi or maki, but I really enjoy their rice bowls and tempura. This location is not terribly busy so you won't have to wait in line for too long. 

They also provide catering options so you can have sushi and maki platters at your functions.

The service has always been good, for fast food. And I know I can keep somewhat on my eating plan when I go here. It's a fast lunch or dinner if you're in a hurry to.
--------------------
A wee bit pricey for the portions they serve. I come to Beck's for their gator gumbo over jambalaya. The whole thing is just so savory and the spices are just right. It's not overly spicy and not too salty as well. It's a great meal. The gator is in a sausage form. All chopped up into the gumbo. During this visit, I had to order their pasta. Chicken alfredo, for my 2 year old son. It was alright. The whole pasta tasted a bit dry. It's something I wouldn't get twice.

Verdict - Gator gumbo, end of story.
--------------------
I got a cheap haircut in NY for next to nothing and what do you know. it looks like some crazy chimp chewed up my hair and spat  it back on my raw scalp.

Since I'm going for job interviews, I needed to look better and went to Domenick's. The guys were great, Robert cut my hair and did a clean job. Bill came out to $35. I'd give it a 4, but it was a little pricy for my taste, but I look human again. Don't know what you guys in Philly normally pay for a haircut.
--------------------
Very impressed with this place, particularly the menu (amazing) and the food. We ordered the fruit bruschetta (yum, what an awesome idea!) and the Popeye skillet and the Roadhouse sw. Great food, creative options! Couple areas of critique: it was FREEZING (every woman had a sweater on in July) and lack of ambiance. The latter could be easily remedied with some decent background music, and better lighting? (Overhead office lighting is a drag, but large windows a plus) Customer service was good not great, tad disconnected...but it was a holiday weekend. Overall, a keeper. I'll def be back!
--------------------
Large menu. Clean restaurant and restroom. Friendly staff. They were fairly busy in the middle of the day when we visited. This was my first time here and all we had was a sandwich so I can't give them 5 stars yet but for a family style restaurant and bar we enjoyed our meal. They had a decent draft beer selection and also serve wine and mixed drinks. There are crayons on every table and instead of a single place mat they put a large sheet of white paper on the tables for the kids to draw on.
--------------------
I'm so happy we came upon this place randomly. They have a happy hour 3-8pm everyday:  Half off all beers, $3-$4 glasses of wine & $8 hookah! Their hookah on non-happy hour is $13. They have a wide selection of shisha flavors and even options of an ice chamber or smoking from a fruit bowl (extra charge). They do have a food menu, but I didn't try anything from it. But the plates I saw coming from the kitchen look pretty good. Overall, a really chill place to come and relax with friends. It was definitely an enjoyable experience.
--------------------
After trying a few ramen places with crazy variety in their selections and stellar broth, I was not too excited about the ramen I got at Cheu.  Maybe it's a matter of taste, but personally, I was not a fan of their thick noodles, and extremely salty broth.  

The service was great, and they had a nice selection of beers!  The friend I went with loved it, and has been many times.  Honestly, I'm just sorry I wasn't a bigger fan.  But I hope others try it for themselves.  I might just be an oddball out on this one.
--------------------
We loved the food, service and decor! The minute we walked in for a late lunch we were greeted with a huge smile and a warm welcome from the manager. Our server, Christina (i think that was her name) was delightful. The beer selection was great. We had the chicken rabe sandwhich and pepperoni pizza. The sandwhich was very good, on tasty foccacia bread. The pizza was superb!  We love the "well done" taste. We will definately be back. One problem we may have is our 7 year old is very picky and we didn't see a chidren's menu.
--------------------
Went for a bachelorette party on a Saturday night in April. Definitely try to arrive on the earlier side! We got there at 8 and there was no line (by the time we left at around 11 there was a line down the street). The cover band is awesome. There were at least 10 other bachelorette groups there and a few 50th birthday parties too. Their signature cocktails are great but overpriced in my opinion. I would go back though for another bachelorette party or birthday. Probably wouldn't try if it was any regular night out. Gets very crowded.
--------------------
I've been a fan of this place for a long time! Their hazelnut cake is awesome, as are many of their other cakes. I was 'sent' there years ago by recommendation for this signature cake and it more than lived up to it's reputation.

Their butter cookies are awesome -  absolutely love them. I frequently stop in to get cookie gifts to give to family and friends for special occasions - always a huge hit!

I think their prices are right in line with their products. They are always consistently great.

The people that work there are wonderful - friendly and helpful!
--------------------
I love the Brewpub for their variety of dishes.  Nachos, pizza and sandwiches.  Variety of beers to choose from crafted right on sight.  

Every time we go, the service is slow.  I think it's just the pace of the restaurant.  It's never a quick beer and a bite of food.  Instead, enjoy the patio and friends, savor that time.  

Kid and dog friendly environment.  Also great for your vegetarian and vegan friends.  

My go to is a half order of the nachos or fish & chips.  

Tried their Pumpkin Seasonal Beer and it's on par with some of my favorite pumpkins.
--------------------
My go to menu is coconut soup and pad thai with protein. I tried same menu here. 
Actually really like their coconut soup. They used enough amount of coconut milk that soup was really creamy and wasn't over powering with herb. I am so used to Americanized thai cuisine that I prefer less herb on my dish except cilantro.
Pat thai was great too. Liked the amount of peanut they used, noodle was chewy and perfect and not too sweet. They gave me generous amount of chicken and white meat wasn't dry so I was very happy with my meal.
--------------------
Not sure why it took until now for us to find this place. We started out going to the chain lobster restaurant but wanted something more authentic. A friend recommended Lobster Haven and I checked it out online. Looked like a type of place we would eat at in Massachusetts when we visit family. We were not disappointed! Service was great, fast and very friendly. Huge selection of all of the favorites. You have to visit this place if you want authentic New England seafood. You can also purchase live lobster and fresh seafood to go and cook it yourself.
--------------------
Really nice staff but mediocre Italian food served luke warm.   We went here for a large group dinner around Christmas mostly because it was a BYOB and there was no fixed menu for a group of 10.   We ordered numerous appetizers including, fried gnocchi, calamari, garlic pizza bread, fried zucchini.   It was all just ok.   The main courses were unadventurous Italian American selections.  The sauces were just meh.   Three of us ordered 3 different chicken dishes and they all came out with the same sauce.   Boring.  Although the staff was very accommodating, the food was too lack luster to return.
--------------------
AMAZING!!! I just got back from the bakery. I ordered tres leche, hubby got chocolate dipped cannoli with original filling, we also got Italian wedding cookies, and dark chocolate florentine cookies. The tres leche taste just like my grandma used to make it minus the Malibu liquor. The cannoli was delicious. The Italian wedding cookies was a little crunchy yet still delicate, it also had the perfect amount of Anise flavor. The dark chocolate florentine is so yummy, that says a lot because I don't like coconut. The chocolate to coconut ratio is perfect. We will definitely be going back.
--------------------
We've been going to this place since it opened and it's always decent, not to mention super fast! TdM is owned by Subway and has a similar feel to it, but I think the quality is much better than Subway. It's a build-your-own burrito and taco place and the ingredients are always fresh and well-stocked. I usually eat vegetarian, so there are plenty of options for me to eat. I always get a veggie burrito and load it up with lots of veggies! I also like their chips and "medium" salsa. If ever around Delgado, check out Taco del Mar!
--------------------
Let me start by saying that the food here is by far the best Mexican I have had in St Pete.  It's nothing fancy and very small but if your looking for some good food and a beer this is the place to go to. Weekend nights do get a little hectic so I would recommend going on a weekday night or during the day so you can skip the long wait to place your order. For the meat lovers out there you can't go wrong with a chorizo taco and for the seafood junkies the fish tacos are amazing!
--------------------
They just opened today and WOW! Aren't we lucky to now have 2 meaderies within a mile or two of each other. 
Mead is a type of fermented honey beverage. The ABV (alcohol percent) is generally 10-14% so more along the lines of wine than beer there. 

We tried Goober Vitis (peanut butter and jelly), Suzy's Cherry Pie, and the coffee one. All were PERFECT. Flavors are pure, beautiful nose, all around great. 

The space is very nice, nice big tables that seat 6-8 easily, an L-shaped bar, a stand-up bar around the tanks, then there are picnic tables outside.
--------------------
Came back again bc I am stuck with a membership... The facilities are nice but they do NOT do a good job. Been coming here for 6 months because of the membership I bought. Every time I have to have them re-vacuum or wipe everything down again. They don't clean out the cup holders or wipe the door kick panels. So frustrating. Some of them on the vacuum side do not seem to speak English so it's even harder to have to explain I need it re-washed :( too bad... The location is perfect for me, if only the quality was
--------------------
I stopped in to order take out and get a drink while I waited since it was happy hour. I am usually a beer drinker but I decided to step out of my comfort zone and ordered the dragonberry iced tea which was refreshing but not obnoxiously cocktail-ly, very pleasant. I had lemongrass chicken and crab rangoon, the lemon grass chicken and rice was fantastic. I do wish the crab rangoon had a little more filling but the dipping sauce was great. I've been here a few times and I have never been disappointed in the food or the service.
--------------------
I wish they served a bigger menu of dim sum because it's amazing here! In my opinion, this is the best place for dim sum in reno (CaiE's oriental cafe seems like they serve pre-frozen dim sum). We order in advance and dine in. Whenever I'm craving chicken feet and siu mai, this is the go to. Unless we can go over the hill to Sac. 

They have a good combo meal. I enjoy their sesame chicken with fried rice. Hubby gets beef and broccoli or shrimp and vegetables. Comes with a nice combo appetizer and/or hot cup of soup.
--------------------
If you decide to eat here, just be aware it is going to take about 2 hours from beginning to end. We have tried it multiple times, because I want to like it! I have been to it's other locations in NJ and never had a bad experience. 

The food is good, but it takes a very long time to come out. The waitstaff is very young, but usually pleasant. We have just had too many experiences where we spent way too long waiting. We usually opt for another diner or restaurant on the weekends, in order to be done quicker.
--------------------
Straight to the point, it's cheap, it tastes and feels cheap

The good: price, location, dessert (edible food items are: baked chicken, fried chicken, mashed potatoes, Salad bar lol, meat and cheese bar, ravioli, pizza) also our waitress was bomb af

The meh: behind counter meat slicing station, shrimp (not even deveined), Mexican station

The bad: breakfast -worst eggs ever, actually worst, eggs. Le Benedict can't even cut through ham or English muffin (tried on all 3 occasions), steak, shrimp again, hell breaded items can't even, don't even. Decor it's the 1970 nightmare you can imagine

Tried 3 times and failed
--------------------
Rebecca didn't Doula my birth.  BUT, she was our nanny to our first born daughter.  Over the months of her being in my home, I realized that I looked forward to talking to her before & after work.  I was big & pregnant with Baby #2, and her information & suggestions hit home with this expectant Momma!  She was always easy to talk with, yet honest and extremely truthful!  (A trait I LOVE!!!).  She loves the special role she plays as Doula to laboring woman!!  She finds beauty and strength in that magical time.
Bec would be a great addition to your support team!!!
--------------------
Underrated burger alert!!

Randomly came into Pag's during a stroll around Doylestown. The menu wasn't super appealing, actually, so I just went with a cheeseburger. Legitimately, one of the best cheeseburgers I've had in a while! Tasted like a quality Big Mac! Patty wasn't too thick, bun didn't overshadow the burger and whatever sauce they used - YUM.

We were in the wine bar section - ambiance is really nice; def not very kid friendly (we had our son with us.) but staff was friendly and accommodating.

We will totally be back next time we are in the mood for a good burger!
--------------------
Came here with some friends during Mardi Gras. Even though it was a busy weekend and lots of people everywhere a lot of places aren't over crowded. The bartenders were just awful. The service was lacking and the pizza sucked. 

PROS:
-They had Port-O-Potty (2) put back which made it easier for a bathroom break
-Outdoor seating area
-Near the parade route (convenient) 

CONS:
-Bartenders don't take drink orders properly: they skip people, ignore you at the bar when you walk up (it wasn't that busy), lots of standing around
-Bartenders didn't know what microbrew meant or IPA beers (no joke)
--------------------
A very nice hotel and a good value. ($175/night) The king bed was primo, the room tastefully furnished. The  rotating Carousel bar is fun and the pool at the top of the building is a great way to cool off on a 95 degree day.We stay there given the great location in the French  Quarter, but our room facing Royal St. was very loud, especially on Friday night. Try for a room not facing the street if you are there over a weekend. Make sure they remove the extra $60 per night they tack on to your room charge for incidentals.
--------------------
This easter instead of going to Lopez Lake we went to Los Padres National Forest which is really pretty but if you go to white rock the staff needs to cut down all the dead grass that invades the rock and the water. I would wish the staff would also clean or get rid of the dead grass that's also living by the water. The water is really green and dirty. Los padres national forest staff need to work hard to maintain this forest looking pretty and not like a dumpster. Even Cachuma lake looks like they put a bit more effort.
--------------------
I cannot even believe someone gave this place one star. Here's the scoop. They have the BEST cannoli in the city. Termini's are no where NEAR as good, and Isgro's is far too hyped up for the quality. Potito's is my go to for cannoli, i wouldn't even THINK about going anywhere else. I'm there every xmas eve, and will be for the rest of my days. I stood in line for isgros for TWO HOURS this year for a tirimisu, i walked right into potito's and picked up my bambino cannoli stuffed cannoli. it's as good as it sounds, trust me.
--------------------
As airport grab-and-go restaurants are, Earl does a decent job with a variety of sandwich options including turkey, tuna and even a Hawaiian. But today I could smell the roast beef and so I got that one. Yum. Good portion of sliced beef that was beyond medium cooked with cheddar cheese and a yummy horseradish sauce. Nope, don't get lettuce or tomatoes on it. It's perfect the way it is.

And since it's right between the security station and the top of the D gates (right near the Delta SkyClub!), it's easy to get and eat at the gate or on board.
--------------------
They reopened up derived new management.. this was our 3rd time there. They have daily specials, which is a pretty good price, $7.95 for a plate, ice-tea and soup. Todays (Friday)special, they had Carne Asada with rice n beans, fried fish plate and 2 chicken enchiladas with rice n beans, all come with tea n soup. 

We both had the Carne asada plate but they let me substitute my rice n beans for a salad. Steak was pretty good. 

I think their specials are different everyday. So for the most part it was good all around. Oh service was good n attentive.
--------------------
Came here for my 21st birthday dinner with my family and had a great experience! The food and drinks were to die for, but they were extremely overpriced. Even though the quality of food was good, I still don't think it was worth what we paid for. I recommend getting the lobster mac and cheese as an appetizer, it was probably the best mac and cheese I've ever eaten. At the end of the meal, they gave us some small complimentary desserts, even though we ordered a bunch of desserts to top off our meal. Had a great time, but definitely overpriced.
--------------------
I can't believe I have to give a star.  Quick rundown.  I ordered:
single with no ketchup, mayo, or mustard with med fried and large unsweetened teas
double with everything lg fries large coke
2 5 piece nuggets
side salad
cheeseburger kids meal plain with oranges and vanilla frosty.
Ok now for what I GOT:
double with bacon, no ketchup mayo or mustard, lg fries, coke
single with everything, lg fries coke
hamburger kids meal with fries and coke
right around the time I said no ketchup a blank look came across the face of the employee.
This is not rocket science.
--------------------
Being a vegetarian while visiting New Orleans is no easy feat.  However, when I have found eats, they are usually very good.  Tomasito's was below the standard I have gotten used to.  Not to say it was bad, not at all.  I had the chips and a bean and cheese burrito. I would have gotten rice in my burrito but it was not vegetarian (really?).  Service was ok, and the flan was excellent (although "with berries" seems to mean one raspberry).
That being said, at least there was food to eat on the menu, and that is not assumes in New Orleans.
--------------------
This is a very mediocre place.  The location itself is in the same dirty strip mall as Mozzarella Pizza. The inside has that "we don't really care about the looks" feel to it.  It's not dirty, per se.  It just doesn't look very clean.  Everything looks like its falling apart.  It probably gets its business from suburbanites like me craving what we think of as Chinese food.

All that said, the food I had was palatable.  Nothing outstanding or amazing: it was just all right.  I won't recommend against it, but it's nothing that you would think of as that great either.
--------------------
lit!!!!! just wanna give a shoutout to my g, kyle. he was such a chill waiter and deserves a raise or somethin. he recommended me the honey hot sauce and it was some of the best hot sauce i had eaten in ages. kyle from milk and honey changed my life and i will forever owe him. also the biscuits brought me to heaven. i didn't even order one i just stole from my friends but they were just that. good. so yeah def come here and ask about kyle. tell him i miss him and that i hope we get reunited soon.
--------------------
I think its funny that my car needed a jump infront of their shop on broad street and i was told No because of not being able to leave the store. When asked if another employee could help he said no he is about to leave. I then asked if he can give me a jump when he leaves and i also got a NO. Funny how theycservice cars, help people with cars but cant even give me a jump. Lame service. Not customer oriented at all. Typical fat guy behind the counter surfing the web and playin on his phone. The worst
--------------------
Today after our Ethiopian food fiasco (see Selam review), we literally RAN into Pi after waiting hours to be served at the prior restaurant. We must have looked like a pack of hungry wolves so we told the hostess what had just happened. She seated us right away and sent us two orders of garlic bread (which we later found out were comped!). 

We ordered two pizzas and scarfed it all down. Pi has been consistently good on every visit I have made since I've moved to STL. Service is always excellent. Both the deep dish and thin crust are amazing every time.
--------------------
I ate at Puckett's yesterday for lunch, and I have to say it was some mighty tasty food for an old-fashioned meat-and-three.  But I actually had a meat-and-two!  Definitely check out the squash casserole.  it was quite the tasty dish.  I'd also recommend their meatloaf, which is what I had.

My only complaint--and it's a minor one--is that they advertise cornbread.  Yes, it's cornbread, but not a slice of cornbread like you typically think of it.  People in the North would call it a corn fritter.  Being from KY, I'd call it a hoe cake.  It's cornbread but more like a cornbread pancake.
--------------------
Platoon is awesome and you definitely want Steve C as a trainer. When I started platoon, I was going once a week and attending a different group exercise class the other days of the week. After a few months, I was only coming to platoon 3-5 days a week. I loved how my workouts were customized to what I could do and wanted to do instead of a group workout that was impossible to complete. Steve is a great listener and motivator and sets realistic goals. The staff at platoon are very nice and accommodating. I never had a problem with billing or scheduling.
--------------------
I would eat here again, but mostly because it is an interesting destination in a town with a lot of bad restaurants. Great decor, noisy atmosphere, and funky vibe. Servers seem hip, but we were rushed through an inattentive service. (One of those dinners where you better ask for the check when you can because you don't know when you will see the waiter again). Note to Gluten Free folks, this place is not completely safe or knowledgeable and the GF buns were awful. The house catsup, which is apparently a thing here, is not GF. Note to anyone with a car: parking sucks.
--------------------
Nice new burger spot downtown! They are apart of the harry & izzys chain. The burgers are pretty good. You do have to order a side separately which kinda sticks but seems to be a trend these days. They take reservations so that's always a plus. If you are looking for additional options besides a burger might not be your best spot to go. I'd like to see them do a lunch special during the week for those that go during the work day. I think it would help with costs and getting a bigger lunch crowd. Overall great experience and service. Check them out!
--------------------
Thoroughly enjoyed our visit to Salty's this evening.  As first time customers, it will be on our list of places to return when we make it back to town.  

They have a good kids menu, enough to keep the little ones content with options like burgers, Alfredo pasta, chicken, shrimp, quesadilla, etc.  

We started with the Crabby Dip which the whole family enjoyed but feel it was a little overpriced at $14.  For the main course I enjoyed a Salty Burger while she had the macadamia crusted grouper, both were excellent choices!  Service was spot on making this a five star experience for us!
--------------------
Well I did visit here a Year ago, long before the e.coli / colliform scare, so I have not been back out of concern for my health and safety. Darn shame too as I really did like this place, but I must admit that I still am not confident they have their act in order. My suggestion is they need to cook their meat longer and ensure it reaches optimum 165°F Temp, serve the food very hot temp to ensure bacteria are dead, and only source their greens and veggies from USA only sources. Avoid Mexico as they have big issues with water pollution cross-contamination.
--------------------
I legit just walked into Blaze being 9pm and as soon as I got to the line I was told that they are closed. I'm not sure if this is correct as the hours online and on the front door states that they are open until 10pm daily. I also checked the website before coming into Blaze. This pizzeria is new to the area so I was actually pretty stoked to check them out and unfortunately my first experience is not what I expected. It would have been courteous for them to give me an explanation for their time change on a Tuesday night.
--------------------
This was a very busy place. Was told I had to try this place while I was in St Louis.  I was not disappointed. I got a peach shake that was amazing. The rest of my group tried a number of different options that they all enjoyed.  The wait was a little long especially on a very hot date. The prices were very reasonable.  The ordering at the window was confusing. Multiple windows with not a lot of direction of which line to get in and where to wait for the food. It's a great place to stop if you are in the area.
--------------------
This has fast become one of my favorite New Orleans gems! Enter over at the bridge on Peters near Elysian Fields or a little way up on Piety, either way, if you like breezes and city views, your efforts will be rewarded. The path stretches about a 1.25 miles from close to Elysian Fields over to the area near the old Navy installation. Along the way are various art installations, a dog park, and a wonderful walk along the mighty Mississippi River. If you time it just right, you might catch one of the spectacular sunsets. A beautiful way to end any day in NOLA!
--------------------
Came here for lunch with my fiancee and friend, found a small table by the window.  they have a great and varied wine selection.  I got a bubbly and my fiancee got some Italian orange soda.  We got the lamb sausage, potato chips, and crab stuffed peppers as "snacks" then i got the mozzarella with prosciutto bacon bits sandwich which was delicious and savory while being light and healthy. service was prompt and polite.  rustic, intimate, and cozy wine lounge atmosphere with low to medium noise level.  bathroom door lock and handle are kind of confusing to use at first. would definitely recommend for lunch!
--------------------
If you want to eat at Prep & Pastry on the weekends, go right when it opens or before it closes. There is always a long wait because of how busy it gets - but the wait is always worth it. The food there is absolutely amazing. I go there often and love the green eggs & ham, bloody marys, and mimosas! They gave me a free pastry on my birthday once, it was delicious! I wish I remembered what it was called. 

I also love that they serve EXO coffee here (a local coffee) - nothing better than a great breakfast with great coffee to go with it!
--------------------
My husband and I are not "spring chickens", but we love to Par-Tee. The server immediately welcomed us and asked about our drink preferences.  He was very knowledgeable and helpful. The beer selection was wonderful, the liquor selection divine.  The bar food, even though it was a small selection, was excellent. I had never wanted to try pork bellies (the name turned me off.) Dan ordered it, I tried it,and we now have a convert.  WE highly recommend their pork belly sliders! I hope they continue to add a few more delicious tapas.  These folks have it together and are very engaging.  We'll be back often.
--------------------
We won't be back. We got the Brussel sprouts and they tasted like pure salt. Our server sent them back and we got another batch and they tasted exactly the same. My husband got the burger and it was okay but the fries that came with it tasted like pure salt also. Maybe the cook working this night was just a little heavy handed on the salt, I don't know. I got the flank steak and it was okay. I wouldn't rave about it or ever get it again. Our cocktails were good and the atmosphere was nice, but we were really disappointed with the food :(
--------------------
I love the concept of this place. One half of it a café that serves different types of coffees and teas, and breakfast type items, and the other world where it serves bar type apps, salads, and sandwiches,  Can't forget that they also serve a wide variety of beers that they serve on tap, bottled, or in can.  

This place is pretty darn casual, and one can hang out here for hours with their friends.  Reminds me of the good ol' college days when no time could pass especially on a chill out Sunday Fun day.

Bring your four legged friend too.  They are totally welcome.
--------------------
My favorite happy hour spot. Discovered how amazing all the appetizers are back in summer 2011 center city sips (great time to check out all the different center city happy hour spots). The mac & cheese is great!

They have a great selection of beers on tap and bottles. The food is superb! If you're looking for a private party space, they have a cozy basement space with a personal bar. Only thing is occasionally you'll have some crashers who want to use the ATM and restroom (even though there is one on the second floor and 2 on the 3rd)

Just go! You won't be disappointed
--------------------
Had a great breakfast here last weekend before we headed out. You order at the front and they will bring the food out. I had the French toast (fruit on the side)  with an a la carte fried egg on the side. They dropped my egg when they got to the table but promptly brought out another one. I also had a vanilla latte which was yummy....no extra sweeteners needed. 

We sat outside on the patio which was just lovely. Even if you sat inside, like other restaurants in the French quarter, every door and windows are open, so fresh breezes flow throughout. Really nice experience.
--------------------
The great customer service that you get here, you won't find in another to-go Asian/Thai restaurant. I enjoyed the food! The curry had great flavor and consistency. The shrimp fried rice does not look appealing but it is flavorful and fluffy. I dropped it down to 4 stars because I paid an additional $2.00 for extra egg and it was NOT extra egg. I also called in my order and received a 30 minute wait time. Total wait time was an hour. With all that being said, the ladies won me over with their passion to serve those waiting and making sure each customer was happy!
--------------------
This place is a hidden gem.  It is located in a strip mall, but this restaurant is anything but a strip mall restaurant.   My husband took me here for my birthday and I was blown away with the whole experience.  It's a very modern, romantic atmosphere.  The food is excellent.  I was shocked by the Fois gras-amazing.  I had the prix fixe menu and I loved ordering 3 courses.  The short ribs were great, but I want to try something new next time.  The desserts were awesome.  I usually take caramel, but there was a caramel tart that was to die for.  Can't wait to go back!!!!
--------------------
I attended a meeting for the homebuilders Association of New Orleans here. The food was good and they took good care of the patrons. I had a mimosa which was good. I had a small cup of corn and crab soup which is fantastic but the portion was quite small. I had the grits and grillades and it was fantastic! The portion same grade on this one. The price was around $10. I've included a photo of the menu for your convenience. I didn't get a chance to test the Wi-Fi but I would say given the ambience and the quality of the food it's a repeat
--------------------
Should have listened to other reviews--we were kind of disappointed.  The layout of the restaurant is interesting in that it's made to look sort of like the inside of a chicken coop (made for people).  However, the food was overpriced and underwhelming.  We ate from the Sunday brunch menu--only decent value on the menu is the chicken strips and fries.  My wife ordered the seasonal salad, which was comically small and was way short on the actual lettuce (and not cheap either).  Chicken was good, but nothing better than Raising Canes in my opinion.  Service and food seemed on the slow side, especially with the small crowd.
--------------------
Doctor Jeffers is one of the best vets I have ever dealt with, she shows compassion for all animals and can tell you within hours of literally anything that is wrong, plus very reasonable prices.

Dr Jeffers even accepts reptiles so being able to get that kind of service locally is great considering another vet on street road gouges you big time for just a vitamin shot ( 105.00 minimum charge )

Plus the practice has just about every type of machinery to insure that they know exactly what is going on with your pet. She even has animals for adoption. 

One great vet, as good as Dr Pol.
--------------------
Reviewing the food.
Hard to justify $16 for a burger and fries BUT wowow this burger was so delicious. I'm not sure if I was just starving but ordered the Lama burger and the patty size is quality. They also have random ingredients thrown in that you probably haven't seen before like gruyere stuffed in a pepper on your burger. Fries came out nice and crisp vs. soggy and the bun on that burger was great. You order inside by the Nook and then can sit around. They have tons of craft beer to choose from and I could see this place getting packed on the weekends.
--------------------
Old school decor - dark woods and copper tile ceiling (real?)  I was there for the express lunch, a good deal.  You get a choice of soup with the entree of the day.  The gumbo and crab bisque were spot on. Gumbo - rich with the andouille sausage adding just a bit of heat. Crab bisque - flavored with old bay style seasoning but not overly salty and just a bit of shredded crab. The entree was a garganelli with roast pork ragu, mushrooms and creole tomatoes.  The sauce was light and blended the flavors well.  The roast pork highlighted the dish - fork tender, caramelized and left me wanting more.
--------------------
Another gem on Frenchmen.  We made it in just in time to grab the corner tall table and enjoyed the piano player playing some nice tunes.

Order at the bar and they'll bring you the food.  What we had:
pork pot stickers - pretty good - $4 HH price
smoked hanger steak w/ chimichurri sauce on toastones - tasted much better than it looked - $4 HH price
lobster eggrolls w/ sweet chile lime sauce - $8 - didn't look promising but it was tasty
Hopitoulas - $4.5
UFO - $4.5

One of the owners/chefs is Korean, thus the Asian food.

HH everyday from 4-6:30pm, $4 tapas, $5 wines, $3 beers.

We will definitely return.
--------------------
Went to Amigos on our 40th anniversary citing the great reviews. Near to no atmosphere. Food was bleeeeah and the price was kinda high for what you get. Can't figure why people like their salsa so much as I think the stuff from "NEW YORK CITY!!" is as good and the chips are just the giant bag variety.

Gawd... all I want is some decent Mexican fare here in Boise!! Used to love Gloria's though not nearly as clean as one would like.  $47.00 with drinks and tip though I think one would do much better at one of the taco trucks as far as flavor goes.
--------------------
The hubby and I have been here on multiple occasions and we have loved every part of the meal, every single time. Everyone from the servers to the bartender is very knowledgable about the menu and was able to immediately recommend items I could eat as-is, substitute or delete to make something safe for this Celiac girl to eat. The wine and cocktail menus are spot on. The food divine.  My only wish is that they would have a gluten-free dessert, we've always had to go elsewhere for something sweet. But that is not a big deal and I still want to go here time and time again.
--------------------
Thanks yelp reviewers...you didn't let me down!  And neither did Todd and Roberta!  They just left my house and I am in awe of what an amazing job they did!  Carpet and couch looks great...spots where my dog a some accidents the other day are all gone! Everything just smells fresh...no chemicals to inhale and nothing has that "wet" smell.  And I can't believe how dry it all is so soon after!  Plus they are the
NICEST people with tons of knowledge and tips on how to care for your home.  Worth every penny and not only recommending them but definitely will be using them in the future!!!
--------------------
We see Dr. Gloudemans, and she's a wonderful doctor. Friendly, upbeat, up on the most recent research, and pro-vaxx (hooray!!). She's proactive about problems after making sure things are worth worrying about-- "let's keep an eye on this, and if there's still a problem in a month or two, come back in and we'll see about a referral to a specialist."

As others have mentioned, we've had a few billing hiccups. We received a bill saying we were past due on 3 appointments' fees, despite paying all copays in the office. Luckily it was all straightened out after a phone call, but it's been frustrating on that front.
--------------------
Second visit even better than the first!!  Loved the butternut squash and goat cheese Rangoons, and the delightfully filling mushroom yakisoba. Amazing flavor, and a smoky , meaty feel though it is meatless. Then came the coconut curry ramen. Heaven in a bowl. 
My only complaint is when you have to wait for seating there is no way to hang by the bar without constantly feeling you are in The servers' way as they breeze by with deliciousness in bowls and plates. So worth the wait before heading to the theater. Plus, food comes out very quickly so we made the curtain, just barely, but with really happy tummies.
--------------------
The food is really good!! The service is less than average; I felt very rushed, unimportant, and cheated. Was shocked that the waitress withheld my coins when she gave me my change! Do they withhold change from all of their customers?!! Very disappointed.  Would she have done that to a well known food critic?

Will probably go back one more time eventually but will have lots of change with me to pay the EXACT amount! When it came time to give her tip, I applied the coins she withheld from me -they became part of her tip. Also, her tip dropped from my standard 25% to 15%. Flabbergasted.
--------------------
Our first visit to El Sol was to celebrate my daughter's birthday.  Needless to say, we were all BLOWN AWAY!   Our waiter was so attentive and polite, the pina colodas, margaritas and food was to die for, and at the end of the meal the whole staff came out with a very large cake, a desert for my daughter, sombreros and FIREWORKS!!  Birthday songs were played on the televisions and it was very festive.  
I'm so happy this gem is close enough to make regular dinner visits.  I'm also happy that an order of fajitas will feed me for dinner an lunch the next day. 
Good job, guys!
--------------------
Unique  is very professional and, based on my experience, operates with the utmost of integrity.
Responsive, transparent, honest are a few words that come to mind .  There technicians were efficient, clean and pleasant. Their pricing was extremely fair. I can state all of this with the highest degree of confidence because it is based on direct experience, not conjecture or inference. The sales person I dealt with (Mike P) and manager Chris are both top notch. 
The house was left spotless, the work was performed to the highest standards. I recommend them highly.  I also encourage you to compare their prices to outfits of similar size and stature.
--------------------
Love this place.  Best view in Santa Barbara.   Awesome wines.  My wife and I are industry, and always treated great.  Tom and Gillian are ALWAYS generous hosts.  My wife works @carrwinery and always refers customers to them.  The Conway cabs are the best SB has to offer.  One of their tasting room employees just gifted us a Conway 13 reserve Syrah.  Beautiful. ...  Thank you Tommy.   Rolos red is a bottle that any wine snob would love,  but a great bottle for those finding their pallet as well.  My son is 5 and always wants mom and dad to go wine tasting when we hit the pier. Never disappointed.
--------------------
Have you ever tried a new lunch place and liked it so much that you went back for dinner that night and lunch the next day. I have done the back to back to back only once, at Greko. 

I've love the rotisserie chicken pita with fries. If you are in the mood for something healthier, they have great salads. Definitely try the Horta Greens (you can substitute fries for Horta Greens or have them on the side). The perfectly cooked and seasoned greens are delicious. 
I also love the Athenian Chicken (half a rotisserie chicken). 

As a quick, casual, food-first restaurant, Greko has hit the sweet spot.
--------------------
My food only merited maybe two stars but I will give an extra star because I like the menu (and will try more of it) and their design and concept.  Sadly though, my tomato-basil soup tasted kind of like a weak marinara and my tuna melt type sandwich had a very sharp, off-putting flavor.  It was citrusy, for sure, and I love lemon in a tuna melt but perhaps this was lemon zest or something just way too overpowering?  I think next time I will focus on the dishes with cured Italian meats, mortadella and prosciutto.  And also the baked goods, those sounded pretty good, especially the Nutella bruschetta!
--------------------
The bar and staff are AMAZING. we got a room upgrade for have been being on our honeymoon and the view was gorgeous. But, the room was not any better than a hilton. It had rust in the tub floor, and some weird stains on the tile. But this was only in the bathroom, so i give it 4 stars! Great staff, but too much for valet so we parked a couple streets down. That was the only other con I would say. 

Would recommend if you want to be literally in the working downtown area of st. louis. Lots of cool bars and restaurants on a friday night.
--------------------
Came here after my husband bought home their lemon pepper wings. They have plenty of flavors. Ranging from ones you've heard of (lemon pepper, mild) to New Orleans flavors (yaka mein, noonie bird). They also have their drinks. The watermelon is to die for. I don't know what they put in it but lord help them. The location isn't the best but they're trying to put something back in the community. It's in the same section with the daiquiri shop so it's really not that bad during the day. I probably wouldn't come at night by myself. Definitely give this place a try. Hey you might even see Skip.
--------------------
I honestly didn't know this place existed until my friend suggested it for brunch over the weekend. I can't believe I live four blocks away and haven't been here before! I ordered the honeybee crepe and an almond croissant. I'm one to typically bring leftovers home but the food was so delicious there was nothing left to take much to the surprise of my friends. There is a small seating area downstairs and some window seating on the first floor. I'd recommend getting there on the earlier side if you're with a group and want to sit. I'd also recommend this for smaller groups. Will definitely be going back.
--------------------
Wish I had read the reviews before we stopped for dinner.  When we arrived there were only two other tables of patrons and a handful of people at the bar.   They promptly took our food order, but we waited 50 minutes for it to be delivered.   It was only a burger and a pork tenderloin sandwich.   Not sure why we didn't leave other than the fact we were watching football.  Food was just ok.

The people at the bar were so loud, offensive and obnoxious that I felt uncomfortable for an older couple that was dining.    What kind of management allows this kind of behavior?   

This place won't last.
--------------------
I am from California and was looking for something besides the hotel dining room to have dinner at.  I usually use the Yellow Pages to find restaurants and judge them by the size of their ads.  Spiro's jumped out at me, not because of the size of their advertisement (small) but Greek food just sounded good to me tonight.  I wasn't disappointed at all.  The Greek lemon soup was excellent and I liked the Moussaka, although the waiter suggested the Sea Bass.  All in all, the dinner was terrific and if I am back in this area, I will head to Spiro's again.  Thanks Neil for the wonderful service!
--------------------
At first I thought the prices here were pretty decent, but then I realized that they charge for every add on- chips/salsa, rice and beans, etc. I would be fine with this if the food was exceptional, but it is subpar. Both times I've been here, my side order of rice has been hard and dry, and burritos sad and limp. Additionally, the waitress we've had the two times going there had a horrible attitude. The only thing that saves this place is the guac, and the strong margaritas. Their strategy must be to get people drunk enough to not care about what they're eating and the rude service.
--------------------
Buddy Brew is a very trendy coffee shop based in Tampa. Their coffee is flavorful and their presentation is nice. I really liked the fact that their lattes and cappuccinos have beautiful latte art on top. The store has a beautiful modern design that reminds me of coffee shops in New York. 

This particular location is in Hyde Park Village. The benefit is that parking is free. The down side is that seating is limited. The store is also extremely cold, so it is uncomfortable to sit and socialize for very long. You may be better off getting your coffee to go and walking around Hyde Park Village instead.
--------------------
I am a huge fan of P.F. Chang's, so when I found out that they made a fast food-type restaurant, I was excited.

The atmosphere isn't like P.F. Chang's; it's loud and it does have a more fast food feel to it. I did, however, love the way it was set up; you order your food at the bar, sit down, and they bring it out to you in 5 minutes (if that).

The food itself was absolutely fantastic compared to about of time it took to make and the price. I was very pleased and surprised with all of the flavors it had. I would recommend going there.
--------------------
I just got C & B's via Order Up Delivery Svc and what a perfect wintry in home dinner. I ordered the Swanky Frank w/ fries and completely enjoyed my loaded up frank. The fries had a little seasoning on them which added a nice touch. I also ordered a lg bowl of beef chili just because I had to have some chili from a chili house. It was nicely pkg'd and I plan on having a late night snack w/some chili later. I requested the sour cream and crackers on the side for warming. I would 100% suggest using Order Up for some cozy chili at home this winter!
--------------------
We belong to lifetime in another state and were visitingvisiting from Colorado to buy a potential second-home in the area. First Jen The front desk person was so nice and very helpful.   She speaks so highly of the club and all of the amenities that it offers.    I also met Joe the general manager what a terrific guy.     The club is much smaller than other lifetimes however very full service for those who want The next level and service.    The bathrooms are fantastic and for the men fully stocked with shavers, shaving cream and lotions.   You need absolutely no toiletries all provided.  Great location next to the mall.  Highly recommend.
--------------------
I have never stayed at a hotel so ghetto. Sure the atmosphere is great and very classy looking. However the staff is the opposite. First of all, my friend booked us a suite for the bachelorette party she was planning. They gave us two separate rooms and my friend had to beg for them to be at least next door to each other since they ran out of suites. Then to make up for it, they threw in free valet. The next day her car had been keyed on her door when the valet brought it from the parking garage. Seriously? Worst experience and I certainly won't ever be back.
--------------------
We had a mixed experience at Mr. B's.  We started at the bar for drinks and a starter due to table wait. Bar was nice for a busy night. Our table was ready early so the bar staff transferred our starter to the table and things went down hill quickly. Starters were delivered and then we were ignored for over 45 minutes. No drinks, water etc. Finally a waiter in another section took out order. We ordered BBQ shrimp (best thing on our table), rabbit and wood plank grilled fish. Fish was a very small piece and not worth the $$$. Rabbit was good! Hit and miss service ruined the experience.
--------------------
I just moved here into downtown 3 weeks ago, so  I am doing the search the best in every category as we woman do we're ever we reside, but will travel if that's what it takes to feel the comfort and trust in service .
Having your car run smoothly is almost as important as your nails done right and I give Cabrillo  Union 76  and its staff a well earned across the board THANKYou! 
Being a Woman it's important to have trust in your auto service Technician. I trust this shop to give me the quality in service and repair and Smog for all my cars. 
THANKYou Ray,
Sincerely , 
                      Cheyenne
--------------------
Fun, no-frills atmosphere, right on the water, where you can watch passersby and dolphins alike, while enjoying great food and accommodating service.

Members of our dining party ranged from a picky 7 year old, to two 40 somethings and a 72 year old grandmother. Captain Bill's had menu choices for everyone in our party, and they even made some ingredient substitutions for us. 

The food arrived hot, fresh, and exactly to our specifications. Wait service and wait time were on point, and we all left the restaurant satisfied and having enjoyed the experience. We'll be back to Captain Bill's next time we visit John's pass. I hope you consider it too!
--------------------
My 2nd experience here was even better than the first.  I do believe there were some kinks during the grand opening.  This time around they seemed to have more than 1 beer bottle opener, and the portion size of the garlic noodle did improve.  
The place still looked like it would get drafty at certain tables but we were seated at a better table this time around and I was not bothered by it.  Food was amazing as ever and I am looking forward to my next visit!
We had no problem getting seated on a sat evening at 5pm.  So glad to have these guys in the local neighborhood.  :D
--------------------
So I no longer go here which is a shame because The eyebrow waxing here is fantastic. I am giving this 2 stars because when I have contacted for an appointment via the phone, it usually has taken days for me to get a response. The online booking is useless because I rarely have found appointments within 2 weeks of when I need it (and I'm very flexible with time of day). 

I give up on this place. Unless you book out weeks in advance, you will not get an appointment. I'm now paying $10 more elsewhere which sucks but I'm able to get seen when I need to be seen.
--------------------
Food was great. But very disappointed with the hospitality. We  entered the restaurant at 9:15 pm but was denied dine in and was told that though the  restaurant closes at 10 pm they won't let us dine in and can give only to go. They saw that there were two pregnant women and a kid with us and I explained that our home is a hour drive from there and yet they denied for no reason. I had to drive back to home and make everyone eat. Very disappointed with such attitude towards customers. Never going back here. Let them try to forgive them self for denying dining for pregnant women.
--------------------
I was told this place is a must for a Sonoran hot dog. I was visiting from out of town and had never had one. It was good, but the whole Sonoran hot dog isn't really my thing (too many components for me) so I can't say it was great. The guacamole on the other hand, was great! I also had the taco combo - the chicken and carne asada were very good but the cabeza was slimy. BK has a salsa bar that allows you to help yourself to your own toppings and I appreciated that. Service was good, food arrived quickly. It was pretty packed during lunch on a weekday.
--------------------
I've been to Mirna's about four times over the past few years and never been disappointed. The portions are HUGE, especially for the modest price tag. Do yourself a favor and get a pasta dish, I can assure you that you'll be glad you did. I've had fish there too, which wasn't bad by any means, but the pasta plates are definitely their specialty. A couple of the times I've been there they treated us to free hummus and pita, which is always a plus. BYOB!

Only knock on the place is that it's pretty small, so make sure to call ahead to reserve a table or check for a wait.
--------------------
The location is pretty random (at the end of a long winding road with a bunch of other hotel off of the highway with no food nearby) and the building has seen better days.  

My room featured an unclean floor, torn wallpaper, dusty bathroom vents, and water spots in the bathroom.  The hallways might remind one of "red rum" and the building itself is ugly showing it's age as a product of the 70s (as am I so I can judge).

The bed was comfortable and the room serviceable but it was disappointing as I have grown accustomed to a higher level of quality in my Doubletree experience throughout the country.
--------------------
I cannot say enough how much I loved this place!! It has a great old school diner vibe. The workers there were so so nice. I had never had gumbo and they make it to order but they made us 2 little tasters, and I usually don't even like shrimp but I ate every last bite!!! We also had the grits, fried chicken and the split pea soup was the best freaking split pea soup I have ever had in my life and I am not kidding. And the prices are insanely affordable, between the 2 of us we ordered a lot of food and beers for only $25. Great deal!
--------------------
The most amazing thing happened today.  I walked into Andres Richard Salon on Locust St for my appointment with Stephanie, a junior stylist at Andres.  We talked, I showed her pictures and the magic began.  I came in for a balayage, a fix from my existing washed out, brassy ombre.  Stephanie was so sweet, attentive and definitely catered to my request.  Hours later, my hair is exactly what I wanted!  I spent most of 2015 crying out of Salon after Salon.  This is will be the only person that will ever touch my hair again.
If you're looking for technical, creative, and expert hair care, you'll find it at Andres Richard.
--------------------
It seems to me that whenever we have out of towner guests, our go to place is consistently Katie's. The variety of food wonderfully prepared is 2nd to none. Reasonably priced and delicious, Katie's never disappoints. Whether you choose the grilled ersters, the shrimp and grits, the Cuban sandwich, pizza, or soup & salad you will be very pleased and have a great meal. Daily specials hi-lite local seasonal offerings that keep things fresh. The service staff are warm and friendly. On Sunday's, you will want to time your arrival before church let's out or you will have a bit of a wait. That said, you can always manage while enjoying bottomless Mimosas!
--------------------
Stopped by to munch a burger during today's Seahawks/Saints game, and the place was, unsurprisingly, packed. For good reason, too: the Haven burger I ordered was fantastic.

I sat right next to the door, so I didn't get the chance to get more than six feet into the place; as soon as I got my meal, the place started getting busier and busier until I had to work my way through the World's Shortest People Maze to get out. Guess that means I wasn't the first person to hear about the place.

I will be going back to the Haven. Might go for, say lunch on a Tuesday, so it's less busy.
--------------------
I had the Chicken Marsala recommended by our waiter. The chicken was very thin, tough, and dry. The pasta was under cooked and stuck together. There was absolutely no flavor. My friend ordered the lasagne and did not like it all. There was only a thin layer of pasta and no flavor. My other friend was still eating her dinner and they cleared her plate when she went to the restroom, after she told the waiter she was not finished. They did bring her a new meal in a doggie bag. The positives are a Great atmosphere and live music. I enjoyed dancing with my husband. However, very expensive for awful food.
--------------------
I have been a fan of Chateau La Vin for a few years. It has been fun to watch the place evolve. At first it was more of a wine store with only a few tables. Now it has been transformed into a wine bar. He offers cheese and crackers and people order from the local restaurants and some of them even deliver. He had two guys playing music. He offers so many different wines and is willing to share his knowledge. My friend is a beer drinker and he has a nice variety for them as well. He does have a few tables out in front. This is a great place.....
--------------------
I was happy his was my first experience with Nola food and not my last, started on a low point. First, I understand it was Sunday night before Fat Tuesday and our waitress was working back to back 12 shifts. However, my drink order was forgotten, and my friends plate was mixed up. For my food, I had the po'boy shrimp and was underwhelmed, there was a hardy serving of shrimp but there was minimal lettuce or sauce and the fries were weak, many soggy. Needless to say, we didn't go back. From other reviews seems like we caught them on an off-day but unfortunately the result is a lack luster review.
--------------------
Due to it's location in a strip mall near Cool Springs, this version of the Twelve South hipster gourmet Burger Up is certainly not as trendy. But it makes up for it by delivering the goods. Awesomely tasty and messy burgers with fresh meat and fixings. The regular fries are delicious... until you try the truffle fries. They are truly outstanding, not greasy and finished with paresan cheese. The metaphorical cherry-on-top was the chocolate milkshake (which actually had no cherry on top). The shake was nothing fancy, but perfectly made, creamy, not too sweet or over-chocolatey. 
If you want your upscale burger experience but still want your burger-fries-shake holy trinity, come here.
--------------------
I've had better, but pretty good for a neighborhood sushi joint. I'll go back, sure. 

Roll menu fairly limited, but my guess is they'd accommodate most any request. Service was attentive and speedy. All staff was eager to please. Other reviewers are right: Service is thoughtful and attentive. 

I thought the rolls were all fine (Mariner, Rose #1, San Francisco), but nothing like "aw damn!" good. I really can't complain, except to be honest, I have had more memorable sushi. Still though, competent and perfectly acceptable. 

I never knew this was here, so I'm glad I found it. For a quick pop in for sushi near the house, this can't be beat.
--------------------
I recently went here with the hubby and a friend and we got the vegetable pakora to start- which was like veggies and hushpuppies all in one- YUM! Then we each got an entree: chicken tikki masala, lamb roganjosh, and lamb vindaloo. Each dish was superb, authentic, and exactly what it should be. The sauces for each were so good I wanted to drink them. Had I saved any room in my tummy, I just might have! 

The place was reasonably priced and the staff/service was just okay. All-in-all, a great addition to Media's varied dinner spots. The lunch buffet looked promising, too, and is only $9.95 on weekdays, $10.95 on wknds.
--------------------
Favorite place to go in New Orleans. Chill backyard bar with great local music options.

Smaller groups are better- seating can get tight. The wine and cheese bar up front services the live music venue in back. You can pick 3 or more cheeses and they put together a lovely cheese and accoutrements tray for you. You can also choose a wine to open up in the back. Wines have a great selection, mid-range price (almost all winces over $10-20 a bottle).

Great place to spend the night and have a wonderful time away from the packed tourists hot spots. (Mind you, this place is well known and a hot spot itself).
--------------------
We recently used Pure Design for a large event in a nearby hotel. Pure staff met with me to discuss my budget and offered beautiful, unique flower and arrangement selections. Their estimate came in well within my budget. Their staff was always professional and their expertise was obvious. The day of the event, they created such a gorgeous space with all the beautiful arrangements - our guests raved about them, even days after the event was over! I was also able to take home/give away the arrangements, which is not always the case with other florists. And the flowers lasted several days after the event.

I would highly recommend Pure for a large event.
--------------------
I'm not sure what changed over the last year at this restaurant, but now it's just terrible food. Before, when I first started coming, it was decent: nothing fancy, but filling and palatable. Now, though, the food is disgusting. 90% of their buffet offerings are WAY too salty. The pulled turkey was tough, the fish tasted like licking a bottle of meat tenderizer, and the vegetables cooked to a putty-like state. The only thing vaguely edible was the corn pudding and mashed potatoes. The desserts are ok, almost store-bought quality. 

The service at least was good. Our waitress refilled our drinks promptly and removed plates often. The only good I saw all night.
--------------------
This is the most beautiful salon I have ever seen. It very clean an organized with an amazing friendly staff. I was given a tour by the owner Doug he is one cool dude.

Doug has an extensive resume of accomplishments as a stylist, he teaches and trains all over the world and brings his expertise and share with his salon staff by holding a weekly training in his salon to ensure his staff is up to date with the latest technique and fashions. If I would trust anybody with my hair it would be here at this place.

I would recommend this place to anybody local or is from out of town.
--------------------
While I generally support independent restaurants over chain places,I still don't buy into the overpriced center city Phila hype. The place was actually roomier than the south Philly closets we usually take my mother in law for her birthday,but the prices were jaw dropping...quite different from the online menu. The food and portions were ok,and the dessert was something different than the average places. The bus help was a bit out of sync with the waiter,as they were asking us if we were done with our plates just as the waiter was telling us the desserts,and as the Philly standard the bathroom was a bit small to accomodate the size of the place.
--------------------
This are awesome and so good! I love the BBQ pork one the best. The staff is so friendly. This is my first dive into Vietnamese cuisine and now I def. want to try more! The bubble tea is so good. I am glad there is another place in town to get the bubble tea. I never tried it before and I love it! They have fresh rolls that taste just as good as sit down Thai restaurants. I love that they will add extra jalapenos and usually not charge extra. They are fresh not pickled and sometimes has seeds which makes it even spicier which is good!! GO NOW! TO BAGUETTE DELI!!
--------------------
The bun makes the Sonoran Dog. It's like a snuggie for the pup. A first, it seems ridiculous and almost like it's going to be too much, exactly like everyone's favorite blanket with sleeves. Too much softness, too much smush, too indulgent.  Wrong. It's warm, soft, chewy, fragrant, and it succeeds where other famed Sonoran Dogs fail. 

The hot dog itself is flavorful, but I would prefer that it or the bacon have a little more bite or snap to better hold their own against the dominant mustard and onions. 

I'm with the masses on the carne asada caramelo. Excellent tortilla, salty, melty cheese, and great carne. 

Super cheap and you can drive through.
--------------------
NEVER AGAIN. This is a so called restaurant that does nothing that a restaurant should other than prepare food, because the rest is done by the patron. Want water? Get up and go across the yard to get it. Want a drink, walk up a flight of stairs and pay cash. Want to sit in a dirty yard in dirty lawn chairs, enjoy yourself. The wait staff is mildy helpful in that they bring you your food after you go to the window and pay cash for it...kind of like New Orleans Hamburger and Seafood, but dirty and with live music (which is nice). It's a one in a lifetime experience for me...just once.
--------------------
So so in love with this place & it is gorgeous. A very spacious & modern design & most of all CLEAN!!!! Love Will, Amanda & Sal! I have made several purchases to include some mods and atty's and being a newbie I have issues from time to time with the devices. Not because the devices aren't working but I may take something apart and can't figure out how to put it back together (newbie ish) lol They always help me and get me back to vaping!!! They have a wide variety of juices, mods, atty's and i'm always in there tasting something. You've got to try it! You will not be sorry! In love with this spot!
--------------------
Last time:  This is the second and last time my wife and I visit this place.  We were the ONLY table, yet it took the waitress at least 15 minutes to get our order.  From then our pizzas took about 45 minutes (they were both small).

While waiting for our pizza I had to move us to the bar are a.  I couldn't stand listening to one of the other waitresses bitching about the place non-stop while our waitress was sweeping.  Her bitching was amplified in that echo chamber.

And after all that waiting my pizza was barely warm.

This place has now earned a spot on my short list of PLACES TO AVOID.
--------------------
I can't say enough great things about the baked goodies that come out of this kitchen.  I have YET to have anything that is 'subpar'.  Everything comes out with full flavor and with the right texture! Then the delicate and decorative detailing--just phenomenal.  You can tell that TIME and LOVE goes into each piece of goodness!!  I love all of the signature flavors.  I am a 'classic' cupcake person- and absolutely love her signature cream cheese frosting.  Talk about melt in your mouth! If you are looking for any sort of cake, cupcake, pie, cookie, or ALL THE ABOVE...do yourself a favor and treat yourself and loved ones to Sugar Coated! (no pun intended!) =)
--------------------
I heard a number of good things about this place ,but I was very disappointed. Parking is terrible which isn't a huge deal but be prepared to spend a few minutes looking for a parking spot. We ordered 5 tacos total and it took about 30 minutes to get them. It seemed a little ridiculous for a few tacos, plus they weren't even hot. Slightly warm at best. Taste was ok, but wasn't anything special at all. Buffalo chicken wasn't great, the  Bbq and Korean were decent and the shrimp was mediocre. Overall, I gave it a shot and it wasn't worth the wait and effort parking so I don't see us going back.
--------------------
Love this place introduced almost 25 years ago when I enrolled at the UD and have loved ever since. For longest time it was basically just a Delaware treat but so happy it is so many more places now. Just want to know when you are coming to the Huntsville AL area. Sorry this review is not about this specific location but if it is half as good as others I have been to it will be great!!! This location has plenty of seating was real clean and playing good tunes as I waited. About only negative is it doesn't have Herrs chips like the Delaware locations but that is not really a problem.
--------------------
I have been told by numerous native philadelphians that Ralph's is one of the best Italian restaurants in the city and is a must to experience. We did not think so. We started off with a grilled calamari appetizer that was soaked in salty red sauce. The amount of sauce overwhelmed the palate to the point where we couldn't even taste the calamari. I got the pasta bolognese with filet mignon tips. Again, the red sauce was very salty. The filet mignon tips was really just average quality beef. My wife ordered the black lobster ravioli which were decent but overly salty. We expected much more from the oldest Italian restaurant in the country.
--------------------
Average or slightly above, despite the hype.  On the expensive side.  For $10 or $12 you should get fries with your burger, not a large to share for $8.  I had a bison burger. that was the only reason I went there.  Seems we had 1 beer, 1 iced tea, 1 burger, 1 bison burger and split a large fry, for about $37.  Rather ridiculous. And they try to hard to be different or interesting, but ruin a good meal.  The bison burger was tainted with unnecessary slaw and BBQ on it to call it a Carolina bison burger.  Not worth $12 on its own.

Been there.  Done that.  No reason to go back.  Next...
--------------------
Yea! Another Chick-fil-A!

Just happened to be driving down (up?) Bloomingdale looking for a new spot to eat, and saw this. OK, it's not new food, but it is a new location (opened yesterday).

The parking lot is crazy, like many in FL, but the staff outside kept the drive-thru lanes flowing. I was in line for less than ten minutes. *Every* last employee I talked to, and I talked to six, were pleasant and welcoming, just like every Chick-fil-A I've ever been to.

The food was good of course, although the fries could have been cooked a bit longer. Chick-fil-A sandwhcih was on poojnt, and so was the sweet tea.

Welcome to Bloomingdale CFA!
--------------------
I work at the Frist and I don't eat at the cafe much, since I like to leave the building and go home for lunch. But once in a blue moon on a really dreary day like today, I stay in and have the Cobb Salad. It's a go-to for gluten free noshers like me. Add an extra egg for extra protein punch (as if all the meat wasn't enough already) and oil and vinegar dressing and i'm doing ok. A lot of museum visitors and local employees come for the cheap prices and quick bites. Beware of Senior Mondays (every 3rd Monday of the month) and weekends at lunchtime- it's usually busiest at 1130-noon.
--------------------
Its a hotel and you can stay there.

After a couple of stays here I find it is not bad. 

Its definitely more of a business traveler kind of place than a tourist kind of place.

Pros
The rooms have the essentials. The beds are quite comfortable.
The cafe isn't bad although it is a little foggy as to what comes with the room. Apparently its one entree and one beverage. Not a bad deal.

Cons
Hallways are a bit shaggy. NBD since I am not staying in the hallway.
Room cleaning dropped the ball on my last stay. The room was clean, but I found a bag from BK in my mini fridge ... eeeew!
--------------------
Good menu, solid ingredients, but these folks are not sandwich artists.  I had a Turkey and Brie Wrap one day and the Spinach Florentine Wrap the next.  Both "wraps" could have more fittingly been called "crumples" because that's how they were assembled.  While watching the sandwich line I kept thinking, "Thank god they're not trying to fold burritos!"  Everyone in the sandwich line either looked befuddled by anything other than a plain bagel or like they were supposed to be somewhere else ten minutes ago.  Also, can we please hang a few signs like "order here", "pick-up here," "pay-here" to direct traffic instead of the east coast "If you don already know, then leave!" attitude?
--------------------
Best auto body shop in Philadelphia in my opinion. My Honda Fit had accumulated all sorts of nicks, dents, scratches, and even some really ugly lime deposit stains on the hood of my car. I took it to Devlin's to get touched up, and what I got back was a car that looked like it just rolled off the assembly line. Honestly, if I told you my car was 3 years old and had gone through a few scrape-ups, I don't think you'd be able to tell. Ed Devlin is a miracle worker, and he does his magic at a super affordable price... I was shocked at how inexpensive the bill came out to be.
--------------------
We had a very nice dinner here on St. Patrick's day, which happens to be my sister's birthday.  The server was super sweet and served the cake we brought to celebrate.  The bartender was so kind and gave my sister a complimentary St. Patty's cocktail, which was incredibly yummy.  

We ordered various dishes:  tri-tip, rotisserie chicken, pulled pork and a veggie burrito.  All was wonderful, except for the veggie burrito, which was lackluster (but who orders a veggie burrito at a rotisserie grill???).  My father-in-law has visited many more times, raving about the moist, flavorful rotisserie chicken.  

The prices were reasonable, portions adequate and service super!  We will definitely visit again, minus the resident vegetarian.  :)
--------------------
I could never go to another dentist! I had a traumatic experience with a dentist when I was younger and have always had bad anxiety when it comes to dental work. Dr. Dayley is not only personable and helps calm my nerves but is very good at what he does! I've had all four wisdom teeth removed by him, and trust him with my teeth. He is the best dentist I've ever been to! I highly recommend him to everyone I know. My entire family including my parents and younger siblings all go to him as well. The front desk and staff are very welcoming and sweet. Thank you for being the best dentist office!
--------------------
Can't tell you how happy I was to see see Heather finally open a shop...I've followed her as a client for years. She is a color wizard, a genius at crafting a look with flair just for you, and can make a tasteful and creative suggestion if you're stumped, or roll with your personal vision. On top of that, Heather has created a shop vibe that is unstuffy, chill, and totally comfortable. I trust her and the staff she hires when I recommend friends and family, and love that she's made a home in the heart of E. Passyunk. Ask her for tips on caring for cactus houseplants, or chat about vintage bikes when you visit.
--------------------
Spice n Grill has the best Indian food in St. Louis. We had the beef nihari, palak paneer, and naan. The palak and beef were perfectly spiced, adequately spicy, and crave-worthy. I've never had a nihari dish before and I will be sure to try it again. 

The restaurant doesn't have great seating  in the store, so I will take food to go next time. The owner served us and he was very nice, but I don't think people eat in the restaurant very often. 

I was so excited to see that the previous owners of 'Indian Food' have opened a new restaurant and I would recommend it if you're in the mood for delicious take-out.
--------------------
We hired Terra as the florist for our wedding and were very pleased with her work. We liked that she took the time to run through the venue with my husband and really tried to understand our needs and accommodate our budget. The florals for the wedding came out beautiful and we loved the draping for the ceremony and the reception. The only concern we had was that some of flowers in the bride's and the bridesmaids' bouquets started wilting during the day, but we understand that it is because the flowers were in full bloom and it could also have been due to the heat. Overall, we were happy we found Terra for our wedding!
--------------------
Recently went to Make Up For Ever at KOP. Initially had a great experience and bought $75 worth of products. After trying them for 5 days I didn't really like them. I went to return and was told I couldn't because they were opened. Thankfully they let me exchange but I ended up having to shove more money out! Then they stamped a big FINAL SALE on my new receipt. Overall, still not in love with the products and definitely won't be buying from there again.

The Sephora in KOP sells the same Make Up For Ever products and their return policy is unopened or gently used can be returned, so I'll just keep shopping there.
--------------------
Freedom toast = check, freedom fries = check, awesome breakfast food = check.

The is a greek owned pancake house (hence the over doing it on naming the food) and is a great alternative to your larger chain pancake houses such as Robert Evans, IHopity hop, and Mr. Dennys. 

We eat here every new years day, typically around 2 pm when we drag ourselves out of a drunken slumber to brave the bitter cold. They never have a problem seating our group of about 12-15 and are pleasant and quick service. 

The energetic owner likes to roam around making sure everything is going well. In my opinion, the food is also better than the chains. The secret ingredient is love.
--------------------
Just finished a State Street Kitchen, Grilled Chicken, Spinach, Swiss and Honey Mustard Sub.  To kick it up a notch I stuffed in Jalapeno Chips for a spicy crunch. 
It was great on an afternoon when autumn is starting to assert itself with bluster.  

This excellent local establishment continues to turn out first rate creative dishes thanks to the ever-present Micha, and her friendly staff.  It has become my most constant breakfast companion, and often my lunch date, as well.  

If you have not been in for a taste of home cooking with a Korean flare, you don't know what you are missing. 

Find a way to get there.  Sit down and become part of the family.
--------------------
I have never had any issues with this place and we have been here many times. This is the only paint store I have ever been to besides places like Home Depot or Lowes...so as far as a paint places goes it ranks high on my list. Not only do they sale paint but also everything that you need to get the job done. Everyone is extremely friendly and helpful. They keep your paint information on file so you don't have to remember it if you need to purchase more. I normally go when there is a sale on paint...keep an eye out for 30% off....we buy interior Super Paint which was a part of the deal.
--------------------
Our group of 6 decided to try something different.  So,  we gave this place a shot.   Very happy with our decision. 

The wife and I shared the special,  which was a massive amount of food for the two of us.   It was a great sampling of all their food options. 

The chicken, steak and rice/beans were pretty amazing.  I could do without the egg,  but it was easy enough to push over to the side.   I'm not a fan of Yuca, but this wasn't bad.   The plantains were delicious.   I didn't try the salad... Just wasn't in the mood for it. 

All in all,  the place is a must visit if you are up for trying something new.
--------------------
I really like Prep & Pastry - we have been twice in the last two months on a Sunday.  The best trick I learned is to put your name on the waitlist BEFORE YOU ARRIVE.  As long as you are within 5 miles of the restaurant, you can be added.  It is a great service.

I have tried a number of things for brunch and all have been excellent - even their sweets. I think my favorite is the breakfast sandwich.  I am not a big drinker, so I usually order the ice team and it really is better than almost anything else I have tried. 

Staff is really, really nice.  I highly recommend a visit if you are in town.
--------------------
My hair is a work in progress. I have been trying to get an A-line bob for a bit over a year now with little success until today! Jenna Moore was referred by a friend and on my god I'm so glad she did. Jenna is amazing. She listen to everything I had to say and told me what she was going to do to make sure we were both on the same page. Not only did she listen but she delivered too! I know my hair needs some healing, Jenna doing the healing, and growing to get where I want to be but I actually see it in the future now thanks to Jenna. HIGHLY HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!!
--------------------
The lady who works here is a miracle worker! I came in with a couple pairs of pants that needed to be hemmed, and a suit jacket whose sleeves needed to be shortened (both of which are not quick and easy, since suits are normally lined and it's a lot of work). I also needed it to be done fast - I was leaving the country the next day. Not only did she do all of these alterations in a day, they were also excellently done - neat and professional - and now I have a beautiful suit that fits me brilliantly for my business trip! Plus, they take all credit cards - including Amex! - and have very reasonable hours. 

Definitely returning.
--------------------
I absolutely love Courtney! She is hands down the best hairstylist I have ever had. The reason I think she is so great is that she knows what will look best on me and over the past year has understood my limits for styles. I always go into the salon and tell her to cut my hair how she thinks will look best, and I always leave blown away at what she does. You know you have a great stylist when you don't have to specify what you want done, but instead they see what needs to be done. Great stylist, great personality and very knowledgeable. I would highly recommend her to anyone who wants to look their best.
--------------------
Amazing pizza. AMAZING! After my first bite, I felt like that Oprah Winfrey meme, where her head is thrown back, her mouth is agape and her arms are open wide, and she's screaming, "You get a car!" Except it's not Oprah, it's me. And I don't get a car -- I get a pizza. But I felt that excited.  

This is basically the pizza I have been looking for since moving to the Indianapolis area. It's a whole lot of nothing: It's not cut into square pieces. It's not crispy and thin. It's not redolent of oregano. It's thick and chewy, cheesy, greasy, wonderful -- it tastes the way pizza is supposed to taste! I have found my new pizza home.
--------------------
Was taken here today by a Colombian friend who needed to satisfy a craving for something cheap and delicious. This place reminds me of Nanzhou, a Yelp favorite, because of the heaping helpings you get for next to nothing. 

I got the oxtail soup (Sancocho) with extra rice and plantains to see how it would differ from the Korean-style stuff I was used to at home. Aside from a thicker, stew-like broth and beefier potatoes, it was just as delicious. My friend got a flat steak (Carne Asada) that I think he ate in just under 10 seconds. 

Remember Yelp, you're missing out on a lot if you don't visit NE philly once in a while, especially this place.
--------------------
This place deserves a special mention.. it's not really on the heart of the city (for tourists), but it's definitely a place you should mark down for one brunch at least...shrimp n grits are hands down the best we've had in the city....the juices were fresh... and for a person who has a hard time eating Omelettes, Surrey's has converted me for sure.. the lump crab omelette with the sauce was just the cure for a dull grey rainy morning...! Word of caution-the place is always full, so make sure you get there at least 30 mins before you really want to eat, just to make sure you don't starve over the delish smells that keep on wafting out
--------------------
I had to write an order after coming here a couple of times because this place is just terrible. I tried their hoagies and they are so greasy i got nauseous after eating them... Then yesterday i accidently ordered from here instead of angelinos and i got the buffalo chicken sandwhich and it was just covered in blu cheese and greasy sauce it was so Disgusting.  All their food is terribly greasy and over seasoned its too much.. Back off on it a little and use freasher ingredients it will be much better!

Ill also add that their desserts suck, taste bland and a waste of money. Their sodas are usually expired and flat. I hate everything about this place!
--------------------
I always walk pass this place but decided to finally give it a try because of the reviews and the price. Overall, as someone already stated they have great apps but the entrees are left to be desired.
Considering each entree costs ~$8, you get what you pay for. I ordered the Pad Thai and it was bad. Way too sweet with no spicy kick to it. We also ordered the Seafood Crispy Noodles, Pearl Noodles, and a Beef rice dish. All were really mediocre. The Indian pancakes and chicken satay apps were great though. Idk why the entrees were so lackluster. I'm sad I didn't enjoy it more but I'm glad the total was cheap for a night out.
--------------------
Food was well prepared and fresh. I had the oso bucco ravioli. The ravioli were definitely homemade, they were a little light on the filling which made them less flavourful then they should have been. Service was great,  the place was so loud the wait staff had a hard time hearing us unless we raised our voice. Good place. Extremely tiny and tables are jammed in. Not recommended for a date night. With so many great places to eat in this neighborhood the only thing that would bring me back is the fact it's bring your own bottle. Otherwise I know I could find something as good or better with less noise, a tad more elbow room, and more flavor
--------------------
This review is for a corporate event in a private dining room with a limited food menu & bar. 

I was blown away! One of the best meals I've ever had and service was flawless, expert, courteous, and never intrusive. Passed hors d'ouevres were creative and tasty. Lobster consommé was delicious and filet was PERFECTLY cooked & seasoned, melted in my mouth, and a generous portion. And that view is just stunning! Actually a better view from our private room than the main dining room, where I've been for a happy hour event (which was less perfect since the space was very overbooked resulting in slow service). Highly recommend for an event and may be back here for a special occasion dinner.
--------------------
After driving pass all the seafood restaurants around Clearwater Beach, I knew wanted seafood right there and then. I wasn't familiar with the area and did not do any yelping before hand, so was pretty hesitant to just blindly pick a restaurant.  Finally, after a long day at the beach, we made a quick walk across the street to all the restaurants and thats when we stumbled into Crabby Bill's. We ordered the $25 bucket of steamed seafood. It was decent, not necessarily the best fresh seafood. This was just a quick snack that I shared with one other person to keep us going before our big dinner at Bern's Steak House that we had reservation for a couple hours later.
--------------------
I cannot comment on the food as I had only a couple beers. I did have the white IPA and a red ale which were good but not blow me away. I might be spoiled having 2 friends who brew professionally but the beers were good, not outstanding. The location is kind of far from other stuff which normally wouldn't bother me but everything around is seriously industrial and scenery does make a better place. They do discount the beer $1 when a train comes by and maybe that's the best they can make of a meh location. Probably give it more like a 3.5 stars. It does say something that there was a loyal following at 4pm on a Sunday.
--------------------
Very cool bar attached to the Alexander Hotel. Several vintage cocktails from pre-prohibition are on the menu. None cooler than "The Elephant in the Room" a bourbon cocktail which comes in its own decanter filled with cherrywood smoke. You decide how long to let it infuse. Lots of comfortable seating and when it warms up a touch a large beautiful deck with seating and heating overlooks the street life. As an added bonus you can relax and watch people work out through the glass of the new CityWay YMCA. 
And yes the truffle oil and sea salt popcorn that greets every patron is as good as it sounds. Get a beer and start collecting bags, once you start you can't stop.
--------------------
Just an update regarding the only complaint in my first review of Kajuns: the smoke. They've since installed a couple of smoke eaters that have made the air extremely breathable for people who, like me, have sensitivities to cigarette smoke. I previously would get headaches because of the smoke if I stayed at Kajuns too long, as I am wont to do, but now I can hardly notice that people are smoking while I'm sitting inside the bar! (When I leave, it's a different story as my clothes still smell like smoke, but that's a compromise I am willing to make.) Just goes to show you how dedicated the Kajuns staff is to improving the experiences of their customers. Thank you Kajuns!

According to my experience, there is just one place in Tokyo at the fish market where you get your seafood a little fresher. Here in Santa Barbara, it does not get any fresher. Right from the fish tank in the cooking pot on your plate. Don't expect a fancy restaurant with a nice ambiance because this is not the reason you come here (though the outside seating has a nice ocean/harbor view). It is the variety of fresh shellfish prepared according to your appetite and taste buds. The wait can be long during peak hours but it is worth it. Put your name down and take a walk on the peer to free-up some extra room in your stomach - you'll need it!
--------------------
tldr; Huge plates of food. Cheap. Delicious. Get the banana pecan pancakes.

Skyway Jacks is now Skyway Cafe. Same great food and service. I love the bovine decor. It really makes it feel homey. This is the kind of place that you think about when you imagine a local diner (at least my opinion of one). Everything I've eaten has been awesome. The service is good and the coffee keeps coming. 

They have a morning breakfast deal between 7 and 830 am. $2.89 for 5 different combinations such as 2 eggs, pancakes and sausage (when you buy a beverage). I might have to start grabbing a little breakfast before work!

Seriously, though.... get the banana pecan pancakes. You can thank me later.
--------------------
This place is a little harder to find but worth the hunt. B's Diner is a little hole-in-the-wall joint populated by neat antiques, funny posters, and the warmth and personality of their staff. They do incredible work in the community and they are worth supporting.

If you are looking for an affordable meal or are looking to have a hearty bite at somewhere chill- this is your spot. It's got that great diner feel and the personality is all in the food.

I think part of the fun is the people-watching at this joint. Whyte ave bar staff the morning after, hipsters, musicians- never a dull moment.

I've heard the Elk sausage and perogie poutine is amazing, but I've yet to try it.
--------------------
Found there to be a good variety of food for a late night dinner with young kids. Wish we had one this good near us in upper PA. Person that rang us in was friendly and helpful. Two things  made our experience top notch. First was out waiter Eric, who was friendly, observant, went out of his way to get odd requests, and quick to getting back to us.  Eric is the type of waiter you would find a quality sit down restaurant.  The other were the 2 people at the grill house station. When I asked to have shrimp not basted due to a pepper allergy that offered to get different tings to remove them from the grill. I appreciated their thoughtfulness.
--------------------
One of their guests went on a rampage and started punching random people, knocking one to the ground.  I told the bartender to call security, then I restrained the assailant as efficiently as humanly possible, causing no injuries, no striking, basically a bear hug, until security finally arrived.  Instead of a thank you I was told to go to my room or I would be trespassing--- fine, Did they look at the video and figure it out? Make it right later?  No.  I was treated poorly, and when I called days later, I got no response.  Spoke with Art in Security, and no call back. 

Not  the way to treat someone who helped you out. 

I will not be going back to Peppermill.
--------------------
Delicious. So happy I Yelped for a restaurant closer to home and stumbled upon this. It's small and pleasant inside with some decent hip hop setting the mood. The menu is small, but packed a punch. We ordered the Duck Fries, which were heaven. Fries smothered in smoked gouda,  shredded duck, and scallions. For 8 bucks came a pretty large bowl that I couldn't stop picking at. I ordered one of the specials, the scallop and foie gras  tacos...wow...so good (then I read the origin of foie gras and hated myself, but aside that...). The person I was with ordered the pork roll burger, which I tried of course. It was incredibly juicy and cooked perfect. I will definitely come back here. Definitely.
--------------------
Such a cool atmosphere and unlike anything I've ever been to. You walk into the wine and cheese shop, select a bottle (or 2!) and then select whatever cheeses and meats you so choose from a refrigerator. Once you have your items, you bring it to the counter to pay, they take your cheeses and meats, and deliver it to your outside (or upstairs inside in our case due to the rain!) and it's like magic. It comes back a beautiful cheese board with nuts and spreads and a delicious loaf of sliced artisan bread! Highly recommended! They also have a menu t order from the kitchen if you really need more, but two of us were full after our platter and wine!
--------------------
A perfect afternoon in the gulch for me would consist of a shopping spree at Blush, a beer at Hops and Crafts and lunch at Turnip Truck.

I mean sure it's an interesting grocery store, but have you tried their ever rotating hot buffet or their made to order sandwiches? 
Tasty!! Or how about some of their all natural beauty products and lip balms? Score!!

You could spend half a day perusing aisle upon aisle of organic fair. This place makes Whole Foods look like Walmart. 

My only complaint: I just wish they would bring back a rewards program of some sort. Guess it was fun while it lasted. 

My usual lunch order; chipotle chicken salad wrap on whole wheat with chipotle mayo.
--------------------
We stopped at Tako due to the positive reviews on yelp. We brought a bottle of white wine with us, the staff did not bring a ice or a chill bucket for us. It took 45 minutes for our appetizers to come out. The edamame was over cooked and mushy while the spring roll did not look appetizing almost like it was frozen. I could buy better spring rolls from trader joes.
Next we moved on to our sushi which was sat on the sushi bar for 15 minutes before it was brought to us. The sushi it self was good, but not the best I have ever had,
If I came here again I would not buy any appetizers. The service was slow
--------------------
I really enjoy this theater! It is always clean and the staff is always friendly. the reason I am giving them for star in that V is because they haven't done some of the necessary updates that other theaters have done by updating the seating offering wait staff service excetera. You can go to the Roadhouse theater for $11 with a student discount or 12 bucks, which is all required liners and heated seats and they have wait staff with a chef. The pricing is nearly the same at this theater but it doesn't have all the same perks. I believe they may have one or two theaters with upgraded seats but they really need to go through the entire theater and update it.
--------------------
Located right at the Union Station Metro stop (walking distance to all of downtown but metro-able too), this place was a good deal on the weekend.  Prices spike during the week when business-peeps fly in and their companies are paying the bill.  The room was clean, the bed was super comfy with TONS of pillows (one sure way to my heart).  The bathroom was large with a tub and too many white towels for two people.  Subtracted one star cause the coffee machine in our room sucked and the door was thin so you could hear people/children in the hall at WAY too early in the morning.  The main lobby is really a cool place tho.  Definitely worth checking out if you're in the area.
--------------------
So it's an old club and I think it still maybe a club at night but me and my family including our 5 year old went there for dinner! The food was good we received a sashimi plate and was very pleased with it. My some received a burger and fries which he ate and was happy with. But my biggest complaint is the SERVICE it was horrible. I had to get my own plates, sauce bowls and napkins, they bought out two glasses but didn't bring my son one. I had to request one for him, I don't know maybe they thought he was invisible. I had a groupon certificate so it was a good dinner I would come back if someone was treating.
--------------------
I really like these guys! I needed to get replacement keys made for my car since the existing ones were worn and not opening the doors consistently. I was referred by my mechanic, who said "go see these guys. They'll take good care of you". He was right!

My car has transponder keys that cost a mint if you get them from the dealership, or a lot less from eBay (always go eBay). While evaluating my key, they made a test copy before risking cutting on the blanks I brought them. I appreciated that caution. Even after cutting the keys, he checked that they both worked in all doors and the trunk before giving them to me. Very thorough job and great attitude. Highly recommended.
--------------------
We went to this restaurant after running in the Philadelphia marathon.  We had a large group (12) with us including kids (ages 10-14), parents and grandparents.   The place is very clean and looks fairly new or at least newly decorated.  The service was excellent and friendly.  The food was very good for the parents but everything was on the spicy side which was not so great for the kids and grandparents.  The lighting was very dim which was an issue for the grandparents reading the menu.  

The Veggie wings were great as were the cactus and sweet potato burritos.   The guacamole was very good although the spicy chips were a little too much.

They offer pitchers of margaritas which was great for our large group.
--------------------
I have only been here on a few occasions, mostly to send the random package, I like that this location has one of the automated machine (the post office closest to me does not...)

But what I wanted to highlight was the fantastic customer service my husband and I experienced when we went here to get our passport applications submitted, the representative we worked with was awesome. She was fast, friendly and knew exactly what needed to be done so we were in and out super quick! She even gave me the follow up forms and explained what I would need to do once I changed my name, perfect. I hope every experience here in the future is just as good. She should train everyone.
--------------------
Service was a bit slow for Saturday lunch but not unacceptable. Understandable as a new place gets its feet under it. I tried to go Friday night and it was a total mess. Long line and nobody taking names. We left. 

The margarita was great. I had the cilantro chicken enchiladas. Also great! The outdoor seating area was very pleasant under the umbrellas on a lovely Saturday afternoon. 

Overall, I liked it. They just need a bit more time to figure out the flow. I'm thrilled to see something affordable move into my neighborhood. The prices are very reasonable and this place isn't trying to be "casual fancy" like the last two train wrecks that occupied this space.

Hope Loco thrives for years to come!
--------------------
Two co-workers and I came here after flying in from Chicago for an afternoon snack. It was almost 3, so we asked if we could wait until happy hour to order. The place was completely empty while we were there, but the space was well decorated and very open. 

We all ordered cocktails (I got the Mint Julep, which was not great, but then a gin drink that was fantastic), and they were all pretty and tasty. We also ordered Mac and cheese, fries, Brussels sprouts, and a pretzel. I didn't try the sprouts (I really don't like them), but everything else was so good! And the prices during happy hour were a great deal. 

I'll definitely be back next time we go to Reno!
--------------------
Been to this location twice and will never go back again!!!!

First time was mediocre, the second time was so very disappointing it beggars belief. I ordered some ribs and had to send them back because one half was warm and the other half was refrigerator cold. They came back and one side was really hot and the other side was still cold, third time it was edible. The manager came over the third time to apologize, never once offered to comp anything. I'm not the kind of guy to cause a fuss to get something comped, but to send something back three times to get it cooked properly and only get an insincere apology really pisses me off, enough for me to write this review.
--------------------
Pretty slow service and the waitresses aren't very kind. I guess I was expecting something different at a diner with high ratings but I understand it's in the middle of a tourist area. However, service should be a priority. Something that really bothered me was how much trash was left on the floor of the outside deck- it all has the potential to blow right into the ocean. NOT OKAY. I had to stand up several times to grab straw wrappers and napkins before they blew into the water. If you're going to have a waterfront/beach front business, be responsible about it. It would be a very easy fix-just a screen on the bottom of the fence. The food was good but I won't be back.
--------------------
Went on a Sunday afternoon and there were only a handful of people there.  We sat at the bar and were greeted by a bartender who started by telling us they were out of most food items.  No worries, we just wanted a couple of beers.  We sampled several varieties, all of which were average.  Nothing memorable about any of the six styles we tried.

Unfortunately,  the staff was in a snit because their relief was late.  I get it, but they were having a full blown discussion behind the bar which all patrons could hear.  Kind of put a damper on things.

Cool location and cool place, but not sure we would go back based on this visit as there are better options near by.
--------------------
Best service in town and best prices. Even the phone call just felt good. I called fast glass and they wanted to charge me 200$! About 80$ more than last time. So i looked around and found these guys. Called them and from the moment someone picked up i was treated wonderfully, they charged 165$ and it was worth the price too. I chip in my windshield spidered out and i was worried about a ticket, they fit me in that day. They vaccumed, wiped down the inside of my car and washed the windows. Waiting area is cozy and has tea, water and free suckers. They all treated me like a person, not a dumb girl like fast glass does. Ill definitely be going back.
--------------------
i was looking forward to a new coffee spot, but this won't be it for me.  they dont have a menu first off, and im not a coffee connoisseur, so i was a little thrown off.  i kept it simple, asked for an iced tea, but they did give me hot tea w/a cup of ice.  v. artsy crowd here, great for people watching, but not for studying.  its a little loud, my headphones were not enough to block out the noise, so i was stuck listening to watever they chose, which wasn't my preference.  the servers were all really nice, and they kept cleaning the tables quite often.  all in all it wasnt a bad experience, but not one to keep me coming back either...
--------------------
I have frequented the Mad Mex, University City location for years.  I was pleased to see this new location which is closer to my home and I don't have to deal with the obnoxious students.  I have been here for Happy Hour and just for dinner at another time.  It has been busy both times and it seems that the staff need to be trained a little more in chaos and crowd management.  The best deals are during Happy Hour - the $3, $5 & $7 Margarita's.  I also believe wings are 1/2 off.  My friends seemed to enjoy their orders of Burritos, Gaucamole and enchiladas.  

The food is average and for the price of drinks - it would be a great place to hang if the service improves.
--------------------
I've used Merrigans several times for work on both a 2012 RV and a vintage 1984 Dolphin. They aren't the best at always answering the phones or calling back but they are the best at fixing what's wrong at a fair price. Your patience will be rewarded with a quality repair at a fair price. It's an honest mom and pop shop that has an eclectic collection of parts for older RV's along with the know-how and experience to fix anything. Definitely the place in Tucson where you won't get ripped off for work on your RV. If you want it done right and still have money left in your travel fund, go to Merrigans. They also have a FREE 24 hr. dump station WITH water.
--------------------
Finally got to check out Cafe Soleil. One word: Delicieux!! Being from France, I had high expectations, I don't play with my pastries! Boy do they deliver, the croissants were buttery, nice and flaky, and melt in your mouth...even better then some of the ones I had in France. Not surprisingly, the baker "Nico" is french, and you could taste the difference in the food.  The fact that the products are imported does make a big difference in the taste, it's definitely authentic.  Nico was very personable and friendly, it was fun chatting with an ex-parisian :). The one negative thing is they are too far from me, 45 mins drive, but to satiate my sweet tooth, I will definitely be back! I highly recommend this bakery.
--------------------
Looks like there is a second Red Kings restaurant in Chinatown and it did not disappoint! Since this place just opened yesterday, I'm not exactly sure if it's replacing the other Red Kings down the street, or if it is just a second helping of spicy, Szechuan food.

We ordered takeout and picked up the Dan Dan Noodles and a shredded Pork in Garlic sauce dish. The spice level in both dishes was perfect.  Extremely mouth-burning, but with delicious flavors that were sweet, earthy, and fresh. The portions were very generous and will make for great leftovers for us. I can't wait to try some of the other dishes and come back here for a sit-down dinner. They also have karaoke rooms upstairs, plus they are BYOB.
--------------------
Great experience purchasing a washer and dryer.  I just bought a new home and needed all new appliances. Iam so glad I decided to go even though the reviews were not great which I don't understand since I had no issues whatsoever. There was an excellent selection, knowledgeable salespeople and timely delivery. The level of service we received was beyond expected! I really felt like they were working hard to give me the best price and offered many options to stay in my budget  They even took the time to check if there were any additional sales prices or discounts they could offer me. I was given honest feedback and all of my questions were answered. I am very happy with Sears and I would highly recommend!
--------------------
This is a must get when you come to Reno is Yellow Subs. Ask for the sprouts on your sub and you won't regret it. It is way better then  anywhere I've ever been. The people are totally down to earth and always are nice and Stack your sub with only the best. Only the best and I recommend this to anyone who loves subs and loves food. Oh and there Tank Tops and T-shirts, priceless, I have a tank myself and represent it anywhere I go. Will be going there again in the future. 5 stars because the service was fast, people were nice, food was amazing, seating made you feel closer to your peers with more conversation movement back and forth and a great environment.
--------------------
We recently purchased a used car for my son, it was a 2006 and of course comes with no warranty because of the age, but I expected them to send it home with us in a safe condition. It was supposedly just inspected and had a brand new PA state inspection and oil change sticker from Conicelli. Needless to say we got it home and the next day the front left tire blew . It was completely dry rotted on the backside and the tire shop ended up replacing both front tires for $450. Money is one thing but after seeing how the tire just shredded we could have been killed on I95 on the way home. The tire just entirely fell apart. Never would recommend them now.
--------------------
My friend and I had dinner here on Sunday. I was surprised to be seated next to another party on the same table with just a small partition separating us. This is how some of the tables are if you are a party of 4 or less. The restaurant is small and can get loud. We had very good service. The food was ok, we got the Kale Ceaser and the Fried chicken with mac n cheese. They were out of watermelon so the salad that was supposed to come with the chicken had to be changed to something else. I was impressed with the soft egg that came with Kale ceaser, it was nicely encased in a crispy crust and the yolk was nice and runny.
--------------------
The Sunrise Family Restaurant is an old style diner that has a very small-town, homey feel.   Service is prompt and super friendly.

I had a Monte Cristo sandwich per the waitresses recommendation and I won't lie, it was pretty disappointing.  Take a stack of turkey and a couple thick slices of ham out of their respective industrial packs, microwave them with some swiss cheese on top and serve on limp french toast.  Somebody out there might like it.  I didn't. 

It came with a salad and fries, both of which were good.  The fries were thick steak fries cooked to a perfect golden brown.   

I have a feeling there are some good items on the menu.  I would especially be interested in trying breakfast.  I'll be back.
--------------------
I've been to New Day Meadery quite a few times, and every time I come I'm never disappointed! Normally when I come here I order the South Cider or the Shelby Blue Ribbon, but on my last trip I decided to taste one of their seasonal items. I tasted the Paulding Light which has cranberry, honey, and a touch of lime. It was pretty good, but was not as sweet as Shelby Blue Ribbon in my opinion. But that is what I like about New Day, they always have a variety of meads and ciders that everyone can enjoy, not just sugar fans like myself. All in all it is one of my favorite places in Fountain Square! Their service is always prompt and their staff always friendly.
--------------------
The only reason I mentioned the media or attorney was out of frustration after he would not provide the owner's contact info so I could appeal to her about keeping the area clean and cleaning or painting the columbarium.  That older area that is out of sight has been that way for years but we finally got tired of it and complained.  He never admitted it could be cleaned up.  As for the vase, I didn't demand just one for my Dad.  I stated he should replace the cheap plastic vases on ALL the niches as they were falling off and disintegrating.  There are not very many of them. I simply thought it would be the right thing to do.  

If there was empathy, I did not hear it.
--------------------
We came here on the holiday, July 4.  This place was great.  All the staff were so friendly and helpful.  My daughter had ear pain and the nurse we saw was very compassionate and patient with my daughter.  He tried to do his best to get the wax loose and out of her ear, but was unsuccessful after multiple attempts.  The doctor then came in to assist and immediately was able to remove a huge chunk of wax.  We were given prescriptions for antibiotics and went over to Target (in same shopping center) to get those filled.  The medication was cheaper at Target than what Med Express quoted us.   It was a great place for going to get immediate care while on vacation at the beach!  Thanks so much!
--------------------
Based this visit entirely upon previous Yelp reviews, which as usual we're spot on. Great atmosphere and feel to this place - Kind of an art house meets coffee house meets Animal House environment. Very unusual. In a good way. The service was relaxed, social and great. The beverages were delicious and the menu was quite interesting. 
I so wanted the food to be much better than it was. Tried the Bird and Pig, a specialty grilled cheese and a couple apps. Everything was good but not great. In truth, if I was judging on food alone, there would be three stars instead of four. But the atmosphere and the staff clearly deserved the extra star, and I'll head back to try some other items on the menu next visit.
--------------------
I attended the #welldoneTBO tweet-up at Anthony's Coal Fired Pizza last week and had a great time. The folks at Anthony's were amazing with the customer service. We got to try so many menu items, and all were amazing. The Philly Cheesesteak Pizza was my 10 year old's favorite. I loved the Cauliflower pizza...so buttery and garlicky and delicious (vegetarian). We also got to try the carmelized onion-smothered wings which were out of this world. Also tasted: meatballs, ribs, salad...all very good. We ordered off the menu a half and half pizza with pepperoni, sausage and mushrooms. So good. If they had liquor on the menu I would have given them five stars (I'm just not a beer or wine person). Thanks for a great evening Anthony's! We'll be back.
--------------------
One of my most favorite Indian restaurants. Nothing fancy but absolutely delicious meals.

Never an issue being seated promptly. A casual dining experience awaits. Service is pleasant. Ambience a bit blahh but still enjoyable.

Now onto the real reason to come here... the FOOD:
Naan is soft. Garlic is tasty but I usually like the original best.  Regardless of your entree of choice, you really cannot go wrong. And although it does not appeal to my level of spiciness preferred (I like it HOT HOT HOT), it has great flavor and is great for the average spicey food eater. My recommendations are the Masala or Vindaloo (Chicken, Shrimp, Lamb... option is yours). Room for dessert? Order the Rice Pudding  and Gulab Jaman, mix together and enjoy the creamy sugary treat.
--------------------
I came in for lunch, my group totaled eight hungry people.  There was no wait and after reading other reviews about the crowds, the stars must have aligned for us.  The parking lot was also relatively empty although I did happen to walk by the one car whose door opened just as I happened by, ouch my pancreas!
     The server was excellent although I cannot remember her name, which is a shame 'cause she definitively deserves the cudos for dealing with my rowdy group.
     Yes, I went and ordered the cheeseburger and fries (my kryptonite) and I must say it was perfectly cooked, the fries at the peak of crispiness and my glass never went empty.  Eight people, no complaints, all in all a great time was had by all!
--------------------
If you're looking for something different in this area, I highly recommend GlobalQ.  Their quesadillas and wraps are all very good, I've had at least half of the items on the menu and they've ranged from, at worst, just ok, to phenomenal.  The quesadillas are very big and are full of some pretty unique combinations.  The wraps are also huge, I usually only eat half a wrap and save the other half for the next day.  While they're all pretty good, I recommend going outside the box and getting the 'Montreal' or 'New Orleans'.  And their 'French Dip' quesadilla is also very good, but for some reason is not listed on their menu.  Check that one out if you like french dip sammies.  

Best part about this place: THEY DELIVER.
--------------------
I am an amateur athlete. I first met Dr. Ferrel when I was playing softball. He was watching my game when I was severely injured.  He treated me on the field by relocating my ankle and then told me to come to his office for treatment. I told him I could not afford that as a single mom on a teacher's salary. Instead, I saw a physician. He said it would be months before I would play again. Depressed and without much hope, I reached out to Dr. Ferrel again. He did treat me as he promised. Not only did he treat me, he healed me within weeks instead of months. Over the years Dr. Ferrel has worked on me with amazing results each time. He will always be my hero...
--------------------
Wow have things changed at this location. I used to come here on a regular basis with a friend. I haven't been back in over a year and so couldn't wait to have lunch today. I was surprised at the deterioration in customer service...,.our server didn't smile, was unwilling to give a recommendation and didn't offer us a tea to go. When I used to come, every server was friendly, gave suggestions and always offered a tea to go. 

The food was okay and probably would have been better if we had been treated better.  I noticed there was tape on the benches where the leather/vinyl is wearing out; this looks tacky.

This used to be my favorite lunch spot; this is no longer the case. I will not be back.
--------------------
We were on our way home from a camping trip and decided to stop in Santa Barbara for some fish taco's last Tuesday! We were trying to find a good place and found out that this was #2 on the list for Baja fish taco's. We were pleasantly surprised at our delicious our taco's turned out to be. We did want to try the shrimp fish taco's and asked if we could get 2 on the side. The kitchen was more than accommodating and gave us a whole platter of delicious battered shrimp. We sat outside on the veranda, enjoying our yummy food and the lovely December weather. The next time we are in Santa Barbara, we will definitely be making a pitstop here again.  The staff is also very friendly.
--------------------
I cannot say enough about the accommodations at the JW. I was working a trade show in the Grand Ballroom today and needed to pump as I am a new mom. Nathan was so quick to help as I was searching for a location that I could use. He opened up a boardroom for me to use and locked it behind me so I would not be disturbed. I know there was at least one other mom that was accommodated at the same time I was. All of the facilities, as well as the boardroom, were impeccably clean. I am so grateful for how kind and wonderful the staff was. Big kudos to the JW and the staff for making such awesome arrangements to support working moms- totally made my day!
--------------------
I recently had the pre fixe meal for $22 and I enjoyed the combination of tastes on my plate. The chicken was moist my veggies were tasty but a little too greasy....overall is was a great meal. 

I also use them for take out/delivery. I have always enjoyed the way the package their food, in plastic containers that I use over and over again until they look too worn out and I recycle them. I hate take out places that use so much boxes and cups and card board - it's extremely eco-unfriendly. 

The food here is never spectacular but is a good standby you will always come away enjoying. The prices seem a little steep but the restaurant atmosphere is contemporary, the service has always been splendid and the food is dependable.
--------------------
We went to Carisma Restaurante again tonight. It has become our "go to" spot. The food is excellent and the service was great. The owner Jose is very friendly and tries to visit every table to make sure everyone is satisfied.  Tonight we had 2 Paellas, salmon and a filet mignon. Everything was made to order, cooked to perfection and came out hot.  

The family also opened a cafe in front of the restaurant. Jose gave us a tour and introduced us to his daughter that runs the cafe. The baked goods and coffees at the cafe are just as good as the meals at Carisma. Good, fresh food prepared and served by nice people. Try Carisma, it's so much more than just the normal tacos and burritos. You wont be disappointed!
--------------------
Another great annual festival Edmonton has to offer.

The Fringe is over two weekends and the joining week full of performances. There's a variety of venues and plays to watch, street performers and musicians. There's a schedule online to find show times, buy tickets and learn more about the artists. 

Half of 104th closes down to add space for a variety of food vendors and artisan vendors (art, jewelry, clothing, etc.).

Good tip: there's a gourmet mini donut truck off behind the farmers market a bit tucked away. Amazing!

It's nice to take an hour or two before or after a show to walk around and casually stumble on other street performances. Or even go without seeing a play just to snack and shop at the vendors.

The location is absolutely fabulous.
--------------------
Overpriced for average food served warm (not hot) by servers who had trouble saying the names of the dishes and seemed in a rush to give us our bill when the place was more than half empty (on a Saturday night). When one of the servers came over to check on the $23 pork chop (which was not listed in the menu - $18 price was), my spouse commented there was a lot of fat....she seemed baffled by his comment, then walked away! The "ropa vieja" dish was good, but overpriced for being served in moderate portion. The menu prices did not reflect the ambiance (random plastic container boxes placed on a nearby table nor the sagging knitted item hanging over our table - it looks like there should've been a lamp in it).
--------------------
When this place first opened we went. We loved the Greek salad and gyros. It was very fresh tasting and the place was cute. We went back last night- the tables were all dirty, lamps full of dirt and dead bugs- so that was a turn off. We got our food and the quality has gone way down. My salad had one bite of potato salad and two items in the salad - tomato and pepper tasted off. I had to spit them out. My daughter got a fajita bowl with chicken. Her tomato was also gross and the chicken was cooked into charred rubber. We ordered baklava and it was stale. I hope they clean and go back to the quality it was when they first opened. It was yummy and clean.
--------------------
Sometimes I just head on over to Kingsway if I need a little shopping fix, instead of battling the crowds at West Ed. They've got lululemon, Jacob, Danier, Gap, Club Monaco, American Eagle, and a variety of other shops that work for me, and it's never so busy you have to brush past people in the halls. 

I sometimes just go for the food -they've got New York Fries, Orange Julius, Poppin' pop corn, Booster Juice, Extreme Pita, Bad Ass Jack's and other choices. 

The food court has a ton of seating. It's never completely full. There's a Zellers and a dollar store and a Sears. I just wish they had a Bay and a movie theatre to round it out a bit. Otherwise, Kingsway is as good a mall as I need.

We found ourselves in South Tucson needing a good meal from somewhere other than the kitchens of the chain hotels surrounding the airport.  Thank you Yelpers for delivering another great place!

A reconverted 1960's era A & W chain fast food stand [I can detect those old bone shards still!], we enjoyed a wonderful meal at a reasonable price.

I had the catfish smothered in poblano sauce and melted cheese.  They told me it was farm catfish but it tasted like the catfish I used to catch out of a lake near my house as a little kid.  Farm fish never tastes this real.

My wife had chile relleno - fresh peppers, not surprising this time of year but definite kudos to the chef.

The late-stage adolescents with us enjoyed their enhiladas and chimichangas too.
--------------------
I have visited the brewpub several times now, and I'm finally ready to write up a review.  I really like the decor here.  It's old-school brewpub with lots of games for children.  The beer is pretty good.  I wish they would do some more adventurous offerings, but I can still get a good beer here.  
The food can be a mixed bag.  I had a small pizza that was a gooey mess (mushrooms and hearty toppings need a thick crust for stability).  I love all the scotch egg offerings (you can get it on a pizza or burger here), but they are so salty.  The burgers are good. The desserts are great (please get the frangipane).  It's also great to get the ploughman's plate and a beer, and just relax for a bit.
--------------------
I love Chick-Fil-A so much and was so excited to get one down the street from me! No more sudden realizations that I'm in Rivergate or Cool Springs and should take advantage of a Chick-Fil-A. I could go any time!

But. What. The. Hell.

Apparently Nashvillians don't know how to use a double lane drive through.

And may I ask why the drive thru goes around the front of the restaurant instead of the back of the restaurant like every other damn fast food restaurant?

Though, kudos for the free WiFi that I can use on my phone while I'm waiting twenty minutes in line at the drive thru.

So I avoid this place like the plague. I'll wait til next time I'm in Rivergate or Cool Springs for some amazing waffle fries.
--------------------
Use the yelp app to get on the waiting list, we went on a Saturday morning and it was very busy, but the waiting list was cut down significantly by using the app. The menu is expansive, a lot of options. The cinnamon French toast was very good. The traditional breakfast foods were on par with most breakfast joints, but the extras on the menu can keep you busy for many visits trying new things. The strawberry orange juice was excellent so I recommend trying it. It was a little hot in the restaurant, could have been cooled down a lot for a more comfortable experience. The service was very good. There were two places to pay at the counter which I thought was a nice way to speed up the leaving process.
--------------------
Upland is a brewery based out of Bloomington, Indiana that has become popular enough to open up a couple additional locations in central Indiana.  All of their beers are very good, and I am also a fan of their burgers and tenderloins.  Therefore, I was excited to try their pizza, but I don't think it ended up being on par with these other items.  My margherita pizza had a cracker-like crust and was pretty light overall.  The cheese was good, but none of the other toppings added much flavor.  There was no red sauce as is typical for a true margherita pizza.  My opinion is that Upland's pizza might serve as a nice appetizer for a group, but I'll be sticking with their burgers or tenderloins as my meal of choice on future visits.
--------------------
If not for the pretentious, haughty, superior attitude of our waiter, I would have given this place four stars or possibly more... Seriously. That kind of attitude is exactly why I left New York. We wanted to order a bottle of wine, asked for his suggestion, and he answers with, "How much do you want to spend?" Ummm... Excuse me? How about, "I'm happy to make some recommendations. Let's find a price point you're comfortable with..." He didn't smile ONCE during the meal service and also found it necessary to correct us on several points of preference. Snob. The food is GOOD. The only thing that was great was the blueberry lasagna. And it is superb. So was the chocolate confection for dessert. I'd say go. And I hope you don't get that waiter.
--------------------
Yayyy for honeygrow ! I honestly can 't believe it took me so long to try this place. It's awesome ! It is in the same complex as my gym and I always said I would give it a shot but didn't seem to make it over there. 

Well this past Tuesday it happened and I have a new spot to grab a healthy meal. I ordered the Sour Cherry BBQ stir fry with chicken instead of pork and parsley instead of shallots and it was amazing. Low calorie and OO so filling. While the line was long it went very quickly and my food was ready shortly after that. I love that you can order and pay right on the kiosk. 

The employees were friendly and efficient and all went smoothly. I'll definitely go back.
--------------------
Yats rocks. You walk in and they've got 4-6 cauldrons full of your choices...which are written in sidewalk chalk on a blackboard. There's always something vegetarian, and a plate full of any of it costs five fitty. Add a buck and you can get a split plate of 2 delectable cajun creations with rice. But the best part is the ridiculously awesome garlic bread...which you can get a bowl of for like a buck.

Not only is the food awesome, but the owner (Joe Vuskovich) is a local celebrity. He's a famed restaurateur from New Orleans that sells his secret spice to restaurants everywhere. Everybody in town knows him (despite the fact that there are two other locations) and he's highly supportive of local bands and kids that most older people stay away from.
--------------------
I usually stay at The Grand Sierra.  It is where I taught my son to swim years ago, so I have been biased to that property.  However, with it under construction recently, and after they took the horse statues out of the Valet area, and began major construction, I decided to try the Peppermill by a friends suggestion.  The Operations Manager, David Fuller went above and beyond to make my stay unbelievably excellent.  We were met at the hotel and "double" upgraded to a Tuscany Balcony Suite at check-in.  Needless to say, it had a balcony.  Very cool!  The room upgrade started my trip off on a perfect note.  Thank you Peppermill!  I will be back.  My experience was better than expected thanks in part to the staff going the extra mile for us.
--------------------
Finally went in after walking by so many times. Glad we did. Small place but IR is pleasing to the eye. One wall cover with wood palates and subtle two tone gray walls. Started with the prosciutto fig arugula Parmesan flatbread appetites. Enough for two people and delicious. Nice mix of flavors. Main dishes were a burger grass fed beef with fries coated with truffles dusting. Burger was humongous!  Looked good smelled good and tasted good. I had a seafood soup with fish ( not sure what it was) shrimp and mollusks in a  coconut/ curry broth. Deliciously spicy but not enough to kill your taste buds. Overall I would recommend this place. We went early as we heard it gets crowded and they do not take reservations.  BYW great wine and craft beer selections
--------------------
So disappointing on so many levels. Have been coming here for years - and the quality of food has fallen off a cliff. Strike one - we shared an artichoke to start - and clearly it had been prepared beforehand (eg, cold on the inside - but the flesh was cooked through)  Strike two - my wife had a Greek salad - and it clearly all came from a bag and was extremely overdressed with tasteless dressing.  Strike three - I had grilled yellowtail which was basically execrable - could not even finish it (overcooked and an inferior-frozen piece of fish - unacceptable for SB). 

In short - great setting, good service - but with such horrible food - not worth the visit. This place really needs to up the quality of food - or it's going to end up just another lower State dive for the tourists.
--------------------
In short, the food was decently good, but completely overpriced.  The guacamole and my Mojito were probably the highlight of the meal. I had the peach pork medallions, which were nicely cooked, but lacked flavor. I tried the corn cakes with Barbacoa and that was pretty good.  

The atmosphere was inviting with a hip feel if that's what you're looking for.  What was really annoying was the parking situation. For a place with price points such as these and limited parking spaces, a valet service should be provided either at a cost or complimentary.  Don't even try and park in the back of the building, it's tight and dangerous even getting there and back.  I ended up parking three blocks away and broke a sweat walking in the dead of summer to the front entrance.
--------------------
See's candies is California base bakery reach Florida. I know about this candies when my wife living in California. Their chocolate is very soft and tasty. 

In Tampa, the International Plaza Mall has this temporary store from Thanksgiving to Easter. They located very close to H&M clothing store. You can have samples before you buy it. I got the lollipop candies. I also bought one assorted chocolate candies. They are very good. The store clerk was kind enough to let us try their assorted chocolate other their typical sample candies. 

You can go with chocolate with nut, mint, toffee, milk, white or dark chocolate. All are good. Guilty pleasure with a touch at sweet side. Mail order through the web also available. If you close to the mall, just go to buy one without shipping.
--------------------
Finally had the chance to stop by Bab Cafe...what took us so long!  Both of us being Asian food fanatics, we are so happy to have Bab Cafe part of our ever expanding culinary experience here in Reno.

With the guidance of the very friendly and knowledgeable staff, we quickly got a hang of what to order, though there will be many more choices on our future visits.  Liking things a little spicy, we both ordered the Jeyuk Top-Bab (spicy pork).  What incredible flavor!  There is nothing that compares to this place in Reno.  The sauce bar gives you the opportunity to mix things up and the included miso soup is a definite bonus.  Great value for such a fresh, enjoyable meal.  Convenient downtown location to take away, dine in or have it delivered via UberEats.
--------------------
Every time we go to this place, we go because of the enticing beer selections, but time after time we leave disappointed by a complacent bar staff that makes you feel like an inconvenience. It's such a shame. The beer selection is second to none, but this time we had one drink and decided to spend our money elsewhere for dinner. This place has been consistent for sure, every time we go, we get a miserable bartender who seems like they'd rather be working on a slow night when they don't have to talk to people. All of the enticing beer in the world won't bring us back. 

The owners brother has a great place a few miles away, Brickside Grill, we went there instead...good beer, excellent food and the staff is consistently friendly and engaging!
--------------------
My wife bought a car here.  I handled the negotiations.  

Our salesman was friendly and helpful.  Once the negotiations began however, our salesman left the picture and we were left to deal with the manager.  This experience was annoying.  I had done my research and shopped around.  The manager must not be accustomed to dealing with informed shoppers because he was obviously lying to me on a number of fronts.  Had my wife not needed the car immediately - and wanted a color that was only available this dealer - I would have moved on to another dealership.  

My advice would be that if you have to come here be armed with knowledge and info on pricing from other dealers but in general I would probably buy from a different dealer if I had to do it over.
--------------------
Love the tap room, but I can't seem to get the hours of business right.  My first visit was a kinda a let down.  I had heard that bier was the place to go for great beers in Indianapolis, but I only found 2 that I liked and only 1 was memorable.  However, bier rotates their taps weekly and does not seem to have any regular taps, I like this because it means that they are constantly challenging themselves to create a better beer.   The tap room is a lot of fun too with people constantly revolving around the taps to taste and find their favorite for the week and then relaxing and talking in the lounge area.  I only gave them 3stars this time but I look forward to improving their score after future visits.
--------------------
This place is top notch, with phenomenal service and such fantastic ambiance- how can you go elsewhere? All of the food looked and smelled amazing. I love how creative everything was.
I CANT STOP DAYDREAMING ABOUT THE FOOD. Hands down, best brunch experience of my life. I don't even like french toast usually and theres was by far the most delicious food thats ever entered my mouth. I am literally drooling while writing this.
The chicken and waffles were unreal and standout A++++. 
I love the "flinstones pushup-pop" drink so creative and clever.
Even the deviled eggs were the best I've personally ever had. They do everything right even when it comes to the music. It was super fun and such a great experience! Ignore any review thats not 4 stars because they must be delusional.
--------------------
Yesterday was my first visit to Paris Parker. I have never gone to a stylist that didn't come with a recommendation in my life until now. I was short on time and wanted to go somewhere near my home.

They told me I would see Stacey for my full highlight appointment. 

She was awesome!

She got all the brassy color out of my hair and made my blonde look natural and vibrant. 

Blonde hair isn't easy and I was expecting to have to go back a couple of times to someone new until they got it just right. I was wrong.

Stacey nailed the color and was really nice to chat with too! Also a must when hanging in a chair for hours. 

Highly recommend... Although I may regret it if she gets too booked up :)
--------------------
I like that Sally's has more options for hair supplies than any other beauty store in the area. The staff is nice and friendly and everything is usually well stocked. Sally's is my go to when I feel like experimenting with my hair due to the wide array of products they carry. I do wish the staff was a little more knowledgable on what they carry but I understand that that's a lot to ask. I also wish that the store was bigger, brighter and cleaner. The cramped aisles, dust bunnies and flickering, yellow fluorescent lights don't exactly give that same "beauty/trendy" feeling that other beauty stores have. If I could give one piece of advice to management it would be to work on the appearance of the store, other than that I'm pretty happy with Sally's.
--------------------
We've been shopping here since this location was a Wild Oats. Perhaps I'm just imagining things, but I'd swear it has gotten better since the merger of these two chains.

I love the produce, seafood and cheese here. But it's the personal care section with tons o' natural cosmetics, handmade soaps and the like that brings us in most often. Well, that and the salad bar. In the cooler months, nothing beats hitting Whole Foods for a post-yoga lunch of soup and salad or the deli salad sampler plate. The Carrot Ginger, Split Pea and Corn Chowder soups are the best! Other sure bets: the curried tofu salad (or pretty much any of the deli-made tofu items), sushi to-go boxes and the everything cookies. My most recent find: lavender soda - kinda' dry and really does relax you :-)
--------------------
3.5 stars.

Chickie's and Pete's is a friendly sports bar, particularly for women, and it has lots of seating for Sunday games. I appreciate the sound booth in the sky, as it means that (admittedly bad) music is played during the commercials, along with special themes for Eagles fans. And, the place seems to be smoke free.

But, I am not impressed by the famous crab fries, which are crinkled, lightly fried, and seasoned with garlic, chili pepper, and salt. Something about the congealed cheese sauce detracts from the entire experience, and I also prefer my fries to be piping hot. However, there are towers of beer available (complete with taps), which is pleasantly tacky. 

With loads of space, booming sound, cute servers, and rowdy fans, Chickie's and Pete's is a perfect place to catch a game.
--------------------
I went in for a mani and pedi. My student was a nice person and we chatted. However it took 3 hours and my hands just look terrible. The feet are fine and feel great. Hands, just terrible. No one came and checked in if the work was done properly. I'm fine that it takes longer, they are there to learn. However, I shouldn't have been charged for the manicure (pedicure yes) or at least have someone else redo my nails. See the pictures for yourselves, this is 15 minutes out!

Edit: just wanted to add that when I removed my shoes, my pedi was ruined. I asked if it was ready to put shoes on and I was told yes. 2 stars only because at least my student was nice but 0 for the service (34$!)
--------------------
If I could give it a zero, I would. I order a plain hamburger, and realized they put  bacon in it (which I am allergic to and unable to eat) after two bites. When I went back to the drive-through window to complain (didn't realize the actual restaurant was open--it was almost 2 after all...), the guy took back the burger, said nothing, and disappeared. After 2 minutes of awkwardly making conversation with the next people in line in their car, he came back and rudely told me I had to go inside to get my food. Which I did. And still did not get an apology.

I refuse to go back there after that ordeal, which is a shame, because it's nice to have a variety of places to go to after DT. Guess Freebirds it is!
--------------------
So this is what you need to know. Everything taste great, well at least what I had. I practically tried everything for breakfast and have come to the conclusion that this is the spot for breakfast. I have one gripe though, the monte cisto is not worth the price and is way over priced. I know truffle oil is used but that should not be the reason its so damn expensive. one egg, one piece of toast and some sauce. Don't ever order it, not worth it unless they drop the price $5. everything else is worth it taste great. Jebbs open face and the huevos rancheros are my favs. Enjoy. oh and the coffee is addicting. Also there are no reservations, so get there early or go about 30 min before u think u may be hungry.
--------------------
I don't know how I lucked out with having this taqueria in our neighborhood, but this is the best Mexican food you'll get in New Orleans.

We discovered Taqueria Guerrero after finding that burrito joint down the street was packed, had a line wrapping around the buidling (you know which one!).

After finding street parking near the mattress store, we plopped down and ordered the 3-taco plate (al pastor, mmmm) with beans and rice on the side and a burrito (barbocoa). I am a creature of habit and order the same tacos, but the bf has ventured out to get other dishes such as the fajita plate or the really spicy shrimp (camarones del diablo?). All very tasty.

The rest is history. It's embarrassing how often I suggest this place when we want to go out/get take out.
--------------------
Really great place for wine!

Came here with my dining group, there was about 20 of us on a Friday, for their Happy Hour. Excellent wine happy hour where all glasses are $5 or you can take $5 off any bottle of wine, which is a great deal if you're sharing with a few people...great way to try a few bottles.

The food was also great! Cheese plates are the way to go here! Excellent selections! Several of my foodie friends ordered sandwiches, which looked & smelled amazing! They all raved about them!

The ambiance is very warm and inviting! They do a great job decorating, especially around the holidays! My favorite space is the enclosed patio area, adjacent to the main dining area. Super warm and romantic on those cold winter evenings! 

The service is great as well!
--------------------
Id you haven't been to the Smoothie King center since it was know as the New Orleans Arena, you are in for a nice surprise. The arena has had a face lift and, while the seats are the same,  everything else has been refreshed.   

Most importantly,  the food options are far more varied and appeal to many tastes.  The quality of the food is very good and significantly improved from a few years back. The drink options are much improved as well and include full service bars, spiked lemonade,  bottled and draft beer and of course, smoothies.  There is even a spot for sweets. You can get funnel cake, cotton candy, and all kinds of delicious things I was too full to take in.  

The venue finally feels a bit swanky and top notch.  We are moving on up!
--------------------
This is the McDonalds closest to my home, but I will forever drive any distance to find another bc it's a terrible restaurant. Even though it's not politically correct to say "I love McDonalds", every now and again and during lent we go to McDonalds and this one is really bad. Bad food, always cold or wrong items.  Bad service, and no offense to anyone but I cannot even communicate with most employees bc they don't speak any ENGLISH!!  I do not know much Spanish either but when I'm trying to spend my money in Fishers Indiana at a business I at least expect to be able to communicate in some way!  Their service is the slowest from any McDonalds in this area!  My advice: pass on this location unless you have allot of time and can speak Spanish !!!!
--------------------
This place just opened up near rivers edge apartments. It's a boutique style taqueria with a menu that anyone can enjoy. The head chef was nominated for a James Beard Award and it shows in his flavorful and diverse menu choices! The restaurant has both an outdoor and indoor setting with double doors that allow access to both, with a bar around the corner. 

I personally have tried every taco on the menu as well as the appetizers! Each taco uses fresh local ingredients with an option for vegetarians and meat eaters like myself. My two favorites are the mushroom taco and the short rib taco, both have unique and fantastic flavors. But I would recommend trying them all, you will not be disappointed! Overall a great place for lunch or dinner! I will definitely be going back soon!
--------------------
Is it okay to say this is my favorite brunch spot even though all I've ever had here is their grits? I would definitely try one of their other courses and I'm pretty sure they're amazing, but it is so hard to not get my favorite thing off their menu! Their portion is so huge, i usually share it with another person (if I'm not being greedy)! You can literally top anything onto your dish and they vary from .50 cents to 1.00 dollar.  I love to add on avocados, red bell peppers, bacon, cheddar, and mushrooms! Their grits are incredible, it is not grainy nor watery. It's just perfect. I can go on and on. but I'm pretty sure you get the point! 

Eventually, i will try their other dishes, but for now, it's all about their grits.
--------------------
I like it. The atmosphere is festive and there is a nice variety of music in Spanish. Service is attentive and they got my picky order straight.

It was a boring salad made with iceberg lettuce that could easily be improved by using romaine or something darker. My more culinary friend ordered the chicken soup and swears it is one of the best he has tasted. And this guy knows food. He is the type of person that has a hog slaughtered and knows what to do with the meat.

So it's a great place to go for chicken soup, and I heard the queso fundido is pretty darn good as well. Although it was recommended you order just the queso, and if you want chorizo, ask for it on the side because otherwise it gets a little greasy.
--------------------
A couple friends and I stopped by for some late night milkshakes and found ourselves at More Than Just Ice Cream. Well, we just got ice cream...not fully taking advantage of what the name implies, but maybe next time.

3 milkshakes: 1 coffee, 1 chocolate, and 1 black&white malt. 

All were pretty good. Definitely satisfied the ice cream craving. I thought my coffee milkshake could have been thicker, same goes for the chocolate. The black&white was plenty thick and was probably the best of the three. Unfortunately, I did not order that one so I settled for my not so creamy coffee.

I did sample some ice cream flavors before setting on a milkshake. I tried the pumpkin pie which was AMAZING. I don't know why I didn't just get this. Maybe a milkshake isn't the way to go here.
--------------------
My mother, aunt and myself went on this walking tour of Ybor with stops for good food.  What a nice time!  Our guide,  Raymond was very knowledgeable and friendly.  
It was about 3 hrs long,  we passed that 3 hr mark because we were sidetracked a few times and chit chatted quite a bit, lol. 
We learned great details and background about the early days of tampa, the culture, people and ybor in general,  very informative! Along the way we stopped for food tastings . Everything was great,  especially the stone soup company Cuban sandwich!  I would recommend everyone to go on this tour,  visiting or lived here for years this is a fun adventure.  And for the step counters we chalked up over 5000 steps ! It will help offset all the wonderful calories you take in on the tour haha
--------------------
Not really the town you would expect to find a great Indian restaurant, but figured I'd give it a shot.
I'm picky about Indian food, and all I can say is WOW it's good!
The Naan with peach chutney was amazing.
The Lamb Korma was perfect. Perfect amount of spice (too many Indian restaurant set your mouth on fire and you can't enjoy the taste). Not too much, not too little.
The rice and lamb was perfectly cooked. Very authentic.

The decor is very nice (those chairs in the front are impressive) and staff very friendly. Service was also very quick.

I'm relocating to Tampa, and might actually have to make the drive from there a few times to come back. Very impressive!

I would definitely recommend this place, even if it's a bit of a drive.  It's worth it.
--------------------
I had just moved to Nashville and one of my friends told me I HAD to come here. We're not both from here originally so technically we were still tourists at this point. Anyways, I went around 9:15 and the line wasn't too bad - I'd say a 5-10 minute wait. The food was awesome. I had the chocolate chip pancakes which were to die for. The sausage side I had didn't rock my world then again it's not the Side Dish Pantry. You don't pay at the table - they ring you up by the door to try and get people in and out fast which seems to work because the line is always moving fairly fast. 


Rip : I drive by it almost every morning - if you want to avoid the line go either RIGHT when they open to around 7:15
--------------------
I typically do my laundry at my boyfriend's house, but I had family who recently stayed with me and had a bunch of towels, sheets, and comforters to wash.  I was searching for a laundry mat that would be safe, clean and not full of questionable people.  I was so happy to find this facility.  It is clean, well-lit, and the staff is so friendly and helpful.  I was amazed at the speed of the laundry and dryer.  I completed 4 oversize loads ( probably equal to 8 regular loads) in just under 2 hours!

This place has security cameras, flat screen T.V's, magazines, wi-fi, clean bathrooms, vending machines.  It is a wonderful atmosphere to do your laundry.  It was not overly busy, there are plenty of washers and dryers.  I am so happy that I found this place.  Thank you LAUNDROMAT!!!
--------------------
Cute lil spot on Germantown Ave. I came in craving something sweet and they did not disappoint. There was an array of cookies and bars to choose from, if my memory serves me right. Behind the display of goodies there was a table with clear plastic cups filled with yumminess, labeled "cake scrapple" I was intrigued. They were different kinds of cakes and icings, most likely left over from a bake. There were about 5 different flavors to choose from and I went with my favorite Red Velvet with cream cheese frosting. I also ended up with an M&M cookie, my other fave! It was a nice day so I sat outside on their bench and had a couple bites of goodness! The cookie was great, soft & chewy with those hard candies for texture. The cake was also delicious and moist!
--------------------
Three chances and they are out! We tried to like this place as the location is easy and convenient. The bar is great, the staff friendly, but there is not a dish I have tried that is passable (although the asian shrimp wasn't bad, but very sweet). First visit we wrote off as a new restaurant working out the bugs. On our second visit I ordered a turkey burger and received a dry turkey patty. No one informed me that they were out of buns, but they could have at least tried to dress it up. It was seriously a lone piece of ground meat (to their credit, the manager did comp that meal). Today we received fish and chips that had to come out of a box and chicken salad that could have greased my axles!

We won't be back.
--------------------
I was so excited about this meal, I came home to review it immediately. The service was outstanding and the food I'd say was some of the best in New Orleans. Even the freshly made bread was piping hot and delicious. We started with the oysters good enough, which were four fried oysters with bearnaise sauce and Benton's bacon- a must get. Then we both got scallops and swine with a butternut squash purée and balsamic vinegar. All of the entrees sounded phenomenal, but we both couldn't resist getting that dish. The best part I have to say was the dessert. We got cafe au lait panna cotta with mini glazed donuts, which reminded us of beignets at cafe du monde. Finally, I sampled their house made 'cellos, including ginger and limecellos, and they were unique and delicious. An amazing experience!
--------------------
Wow.  I have to say incredible.  We've driven by the place several times and always had that "meh' attitude because of how the plaza looks.  Since the wife was craving some crispy duck it came up as having the best reviews for it.
  Walking in, was a great traditional indian/thai setting with a comfortable small raunt demeanor.  We tried the mussel appetizer, while the wife got the Tamarind Duck and I tried the Panang Curry with calamari.
  Service was prompt, quick and non invasive.  Mussels were tasty, but the Duck and Curry were to die for!  Portion sizes are definitely reflective of the prices so don't feel like you are going to get gyped.
  We will be back to at least try the sushi or get more duck seeing as they have at least 2 more styles of it.
  Happy tastebuds!
--------------------
I ordered delivery online through Yelp, and the food took about 45 minutes to get to my door.
The delivery driver was friendly.
I ordered a bbq chicken pizza and it was really good. They spread the good stuff out over top of most of the crust which was awesome. I also ordered mozzarella sticks, and they were not really what I was expecting--they weren't breaded, they were deep fried. They were good, just not what I was expecting. They also gave me two free cookies with my order and I have to say they were SO good. They were a little undercooked so they were perfectly chewy and they were almost the best part of my meal (and a nice little surprise). The price was fair and I would order here again for sure, although the wait was a little long.
--------------------
Completely unprofessional and pathetic. I called last week to get price quotes on a battery and brakes. I spoke to someone very nice- he gave me two quotes, fairly low but close to other shops. I call today to schedule a time to come in and the prick who answers the phone, his name is either Mike or Nick (and quite frankly I don't care what he's called), tells me there is no battery even close to that price. He "blames" the quote on me, saying "I don't know how you came up with that price?" Then I told him I'd like to speak to someone else and he says "no, we won't do a battery for that price, so bye-bye" and he HUNG up the phone. NEVER NEVER call these people. I can go to Walmart before I deal with these assholes.
--------------------
My dad and I stopped in on the way back to the hotel because we wanted a 2nd drink after being disappointed with our first at another place. We ordered the hand grenades rather than pore over the menu. There was a band playing so we decided to sit for a bit Holy cow on those drinks!! They were $9 each (with souvenir cup) and we were really feeling it towards the end of the drink. It was during the day and we were enjoying the nice weather and band playing. This place was on the corner of Bourbon, close to Jackson Square and there was lots of open air coming through. We were singing along with the band which is an indication of how good that drink made us feel, lol. We had a lot of fun, good atmosphere in that bar.
--------------------
Great pizza!  The owner Pete is usually there and he's a great guy.  They have lots of fantastic pizzas, but my favorites are the California (white pizza with pieces of breaded chicken cutlet, bacon, and tomatos, and ranch dressing instead of red sauce), Meatlovers (5 meats, but the sausage is the kind that does not have fennel in it, so more points for that), Veggie pizza (they saute the veggies first before they go on the pizza, and instead of using green peppers, they use sweet peppers).  

Unfortunately, the shop was damaged by a fire in the next door laundry mat and they've been closed for a few weeks, but I can't wait for their doors to open again soon. I miss the lunch special, 2 slices and a self serve soda for $3.99.   Best local pizza you'll find in the Hatboro area.
--------------------
Even though theres nothing ostensibly stand-out about 45, I spend quite a bit of time here. This is definitely a "Cheers" bar, where everybody knows your name. If you can make out their face through the haze of cigarette smoke, that is. Personally, the smoke doesn't bother me, though i have plenty of friends who refuse to go here for that reason. 

I just love the laid back, dive-y vibe. On game days, theres always a spread of food to help yourself to, which is such a nice tradition that you rarely see in bars now. During baseball season, well, I hope you're a Red Sox fan. If not, keep your allegiances quiet, lol. And theres often a food truck parked out front. Yum! A great pre or post show stop if you're seeing music at Tipitinas, which is just down the street.
--------------------
I really had a wonderful experience at the Nashville location, and we found out that New Orleans had one now and should go to it. Last night we got there kinda late around 10pm. Sat there for 10min and not one person greeted us. Went to the bar to see about service and she informed that the kitchen was behind on completing orders. 
I had to apologize to my friends that we may not get any food after driving three hours down to enjoy the weekend. We did end up leaving the restaurant after 25 min wait for no service or an apology. 

I have to say this not what I expected from a big known place for adults to have fun along with kids also. Please do something about this. I hope this is not a reflection of how others could become.
--------------------
I had a delicious breakfast at Tuttini a few months ago.  I went back for lunch recently and was excited by their sandwich offerings, however, I was not served.  It was 1:45 PM, and their sign states that they serve lunch until 2:30 PM.  I waited in line for 7 or 8 minutes before a woman came out to tell me that the kitchen was closing.  Closing over 30 minutes early!  She said she might be able to make something to go.  So, if you can make something to go, doesn't that mean the kitchen is not yet closed?  Besides, I wanted to have a few minutes to relax in the cozy restaurant and enjoy my sandwich, not gulf it down on the street, so I left.  I got a sandwich at North Star Coffee around the corner and gave them my $10 instead.
--------------------
I've been going here now for a couple of months. I have never received more compliments on my nails then I have since seeing Nary! 

I love all the girls that work there, and we all banter amongst each other, and the other clients as well. No more sitting in silence while I get my nails done!! Yay!

I recommend making an appointment! This is not a dime a dozen nail salon! They offer the newest designs and jewels that so many others don't, and because of that, it's busy. You can walk in, but prepare to sit and wait. And if you want crazy encrusted nails, you can get them here! But you'll pay for what you want, so if you're on a budget throw out your number from the beginning so you aren't shocked at check out. 

See you ladies in 2 weeks!!
--------------------
Okay, so it's a dance club. It's trendy and offers higher-end cocktails and beers while still offering your run-of-the-mill wells and domestic bottles. On certain nights, guys have to pay a door charge (but that's not really uncommon in the industry). There is a huge patio and, even in the winter, almost the entire patio is still available because they enclose it. The music is pretty hit-or-miss...sometimes you're dancing away to classic hip-hop, pop, and even rock, and other times you're standing there while the DJ spins out an un-danceable tune. If you're on the patio, you can chat...but if you're inside it's (not shockingly) too loud to really talk. If you're in the CWE and you're looking to dance, at least give the Mandarin a shot; it's not going to be for everyone, but it's pretty great if you're in the mood for it.
--------------------
We went around 6 and it was more packed than I expected. I knew it would be busy but I was surprised. The staff was amazing. We waited in line for about 8 minutes regardless of it being a huge line going out side. Found a table and had our food in less than five minutes. Even with the amount of people they had, it ran so smoothly. One sandwich was messed up but it was very loud in there so I don't think she heard me correctly but someone came to our table and had a new correct sandwich almost immediately. I love that they made time to go around asking if we needed refills and how the food was. So glad to have a chick fil a in Reno. They upheld the chick fil a standards even with all the chaos of opening day.
--------------------
I was trying to find a decent place for dinner tonight for my moderately health conscious self when I came across this place. After figuring out what I wanted and put the Be My Bison burger in my cart for the online order, I realized it would be over a two mile round trip excursion from my job. Defeated, I started to search elsewhere but I could not get that burger off of my mind. I came back a few hours later and submit my order. I hiked it there and it just came out of the kitchen as I walked in.  I grabbed my burger and continued on my way back to work. O-M-G! Absolutely in love with this place. It has been quite the task to try and find healthy places that fit my diet but this is a dream come true! Thank You!
--------------------
Four stars for price. 
I drive truck, so I've eaten bbq all over America. This place is better than most, but it's certainly not 4 star worthy. I'd say the food is more like 2.5 star. 
The cheeseburger was quite large and the meat was tasty. (Be advised: if you don't stop them they'll automatically put that disgusting invention called mayonnaise on it.) I got it plain so I can't comment on their lettuce/tomato game. 
The pork bbq sammich was soggy on the bottom. Moist is good, but this was just plain wet. The meat itself was bland but not bad. 
The bbq sauce is pretty good but not great. 
The Mac & Cheese tasted ok but the noodles were way overcooked. It'd be much better if it were baked and had a little crustiness to it. 

If I lived local I'm sure I'd come here occasionally.
--------------------
Stopped here for lunch on the way to drop some people off at the airport. It's a bit unexpected and a tiny bit off the beaten path on a residential street just behind a business district.

I chose the vegetarian plate and a Greek salad. The salad was the absolute best I've ever had. The cheese was absolutely fresh, the vegetables were fresh and chopped just for the salad, and the dressing and seasoning was perfect. The salad was quite large on its own and could easily make a light lunch by itself.

The vegetarian plate came along with their fresh pita-like bread that is baked fresh every morning, seasoned, pan fried vegetables, rice, and a tzatziki-like sauce drizzled on top. The flavors were astounding, and despite a lack of desire to stuff myself silly, I did anyway. Plenty of food for lunch and very reasonably priced.
--------------------
Here for convention and Imo's was suggested as "The Best" St. Louis Style pizza by hotel staff. 

I opted for delivery which was good and efficient. The food arrived still hot. I ordered a medium pepperoni and an order of toasted ravioli. 

Now, I knew the cheese on the pizza was provel so it would taste different. I was really not impressed. It may just be a matter of taste preference. It was hard to separate each piece of pizza too.  Like, it wasn't cut all the way through. Not really a fan. So thumbs down on the pizza. 

What bumps the stars up are the T-Ravs!  I was hoping for cheese ravioli but the staple is a meat mixture. Boy...do they do it justice. They were the bomb!  The sauce with it was too watery but still tasty. I would order just the ravioli next time!
--------------------
Had to wait until my third trip to NOLA to actually get in the door.  First two times I tried waiting in line, this time around we got smart and bought reserved seats so we could be on the benches. Well worth the extra $20 to not hassle with waiting in line for an hour. It goes toward the preservation of Jazz so it's a good cause...just splurge.

The show was fantastic.  True musicians and great personalities to boot. I can only imagine that this is what concerts were like 50 years ago. The band members were dapper, engaging and insanely talented.  It's in a tiny hole in the wall space that only holds maybe 200 people? So it's very intimate and nice to see the smiles on the faces of the musicians as they share their craft with you. This is a must do while in NOLA!
--------------------
Only had one experience with this place and it will be my last. I called in the night before to ask if they sell deboned duck and the man on the phone said they could but I would have to request it the day of. I called the following morning to ask to pick up a plain deboned duck and whoever the incompetent girl who answered had trouble getting my order clear. I picked up my order and came home to find that not only did they gave a whole duck with stuffing I never asked for. I called the place back and thy never offered any compensation of any sort except a trade in right as it's a hour before dinner time and the butcher shop is more than thirty minutes away for me. Shame that food from this place is overshadowed by their terrible customer service.
--------------------
I regularly go to student salons for hair cuts and styling. 

I have long, fine, mostly straight Asian hair, and have had mixed results from the Aveda Institute -- to be expected considering I had a different stylist in every case.

Just know that if you haven't had a student stylist before, don't expect perfection. Do expect the cut to take an inordinately long time compared to a seasoned professional -- most of my cuts/styles have taken around 2 hours. The basic cut price includes massaging wash, cut, and blowdry style, plus the stylists do take the time to check in with their teachers and make sure the cut is going the way you want it to. Another plus: all of the stylists I've had at the Aveda Institute have been professional and committed to their service, which isn't always the case at other schools. And the prices are right.
--------------------
After trying twice unsuccessfully to get there early enough to get a meal within 20 minutes, I finally was able to break away from work and was 5th in line. I had heard of the "food truck nazi" and that it was the best in town and found Gus, the falafel nazi, as he called himself, lived up to his reputation and more. 
As my turn came up, I approached the cart tenuously, for I did not want to blow it by asking too many questions. He immediately recognized me as a new customer and told me all about the fresh ingredients he uses.
Chicken is cooked over coal and was tender on the inside and perfectly cooked on the outside. Falafel was delicious, as were the grapes and his homemade pasta that went along with it.
There was enough food for 2 people.
Well worth the wait!
--------------------
I loves me some seitan, and that's why I keep going to El Camino. The seitan wings & seitan nachos are so good! Unfortunately, the service is not. It can be extremely slow. On one occasion it took them so long to get my seitan nachos out to me that they had to give them to me on the house. All of my friends were done eating and ready to leave and I was JUST getting my food! 

As for the rest of the food at El Camino, the only other thing I've tried would be the fried pickles. I have to say, I was not impressed. I love both pickles and fried things but these were not good. The coating was too grainy and I just didn't like the taste. 

The seitan is so good that it keeps me coming back. And the margaritas are pretty good too.
--------------------
A bit off the beaten path for most tourists, as it is in the Marigny, but worth the trip. Sure, the place is not perfect, but there are ultra-expensive restaurants in the FQ that are also not perfect. Look, cheap food, especially food this good, gives "wiggle" room for imperfections.

Breakfast served all day is a bonus. Sometimes you just got to have a lox omelet (under $10) late in the day. The restaurant boasts vegetarian and *gasp* vegan dishes, but someone needs to tell them that cheese doesn't fit into either of those categories. That aside, the french fry poboy, and the mac 'n cheese sandwiches are amazing. So is the Saturday Blue Plate of BBQ Chicken legs. 

Every entree is under $10, well except for the Friday Blue Plate, but why quibble? And who can argue with $5 Bloody Mary's, especially ones that are this good?
--------------------
That horrible angst - you want sushi, but you're not SO hungry that you can do AYCE or want to spend $25 for lunch. So we popped in on a weekend for a late lunch and decided to order a la carte.  I ordered a long roll and a hand roll, a drink and a chocolate mochi (OMG, I am officially in love with these things) and the total cost came to just under $20 with tip.  It filled my belly enough so that I was satisfied.  Had I gone for just one more roll, I probably would have broke even with the AYCE, but I probably would've been so stuffed to the point where I wouldn't have needed to eat anything else all day - not the plan for this particular day.

The rolls tasted fresh and delicious, but the surprise was definitely the mochi - so creamy and tasty.
--------------------
Tried the Brew Bros. Burger challenge as a dare from friends. What are friends for? Though I came close to finishing all 4lbs of burgers, fries, and fixings, I fell short on time. Our server was kind enough to issue me a shirt for attempting and "coming the closest to finishing." Whatever that meant. The food was good, staff was great, and the challenge left me with a stomach ache for 3-days. 

I did not get a chance to sample their beer selections but from what my friends said, it's good. I would not recommend the burger challenge if you're going to drink beer. Otherwise for $24, it's by far the best deal on the menu; especially if you split with friends! (splitting the meal violates the rules of the competition)

If I'm ever in the Reno area again, I will be back to conquer that elusive challenge!
--------------------
I stopped in for a drink yesterday and have to say the atmosphere gets an A+ from me.  Such a unique concept for the St. Pete area.  The attention to detail with the remodel was outstanding, it almost feels like you are in a Harry Potter movie or something.  There is background music that is set at a low volume so you can clearly hear your friends or not have to shout for them to hear you - perfect for the old library-esque environment. Working behind the bar were Michael and Peggy - both couldn't have been more friendly and were overall just interesting people to talk to.   I had eaten dinner already before I came so can't speak on the food but will definitely be back to try - the prices for meat/cheese trays are much better than comparable places in the area.  I would definitely recommend checking this place out...
--------------------
Great customer service! We were a little out of their pick up area but they were very accommodating and came and got our group of 7. When we got there we realized we were billed for 8 instead of 7. I called and he refunded my money for the extra ticket in minutes!

The tour itself was SO much fun! We were laughing and smiling and our tour guide was funny! We saw lots of alligators! From babies swimming in the water to full grown ones! We saw turtles and birds too! Our tour guide had a baby alligator we could hold that he's raising until it's a little bigger since it was a late hatch that would have died because of when it was born. The ride back was fun too because we went fast and the guide did some "tricks" with the boat! I highly recommend this tour!!!
--------------------
So much to like about this place--the beautiful Mercer Building location, the spaciousness, the lovely, friendly baristas. But there are a couple of important cons for me. Biggest being, the music is constant and too loud, ruining everything you go to a coffee shop to do: read, work, reflect, or enjoy a good conversation. When I asked for it to be turned down, they told me they can't--it just plays at one level all the time, and the speakers  are everywhere so you can't get away from it. It sucks.

Secondly, if you're a tea drinker, you're out of luck. They don't serve the tea in pots, but huge, sloppy individual filters--it makes your beverage totally ungainly, hard to drink and is really off putting.

Pros: gluten free goodies and yummy Italian sodas. I'd love to spend more time here, but the music usually drives me out after 10 minutes.
--------------------
Nice little bar located at the very far end of Terminal E and Tampa International. The airport recently added several new restaurants with a "local vibe" and this is one of them. There isn't a ton of seating but it also isn't close to the TSA area so it's a bit hidden. Hey have TVs if you wanna catch a game while you wait for your flight. Food is very reasonably price for the portion size. Appetizers run from $5-$10 and majority of sandwiches are $12. I didn't order any food but it looked amazing! Drinks are tasty and Prices are not terrible. Think 22oz Jai Alai for $8.50. You cannot take alcoholic beverages into the terminal (Columbia does this I think). I had a Manhattan for $11 and it was very tasty. Staff is attentive and friendly. I know my new spot when I'm waiting on a Delta flight!
--------------------
AVOID AT ALL COSTS
By far the worst pizza I've had. Thin crust was not crunchy, olives were junk and salad was $6 for bad strands of lettuce and minimal cheese which looked horribly powdered. It came in a prepacked divider. Rip off. Not worth more than a dollar. 

Their knots were ok, and extremely unhealthy, but rest was crap.

I normally don't order from them or anyone else but good pizza like Grimaldi's, BJs or Mellow Mushroom but I hadn't gone grocery shopping and normally stock up on organic pizza from Publix or whole foods which btw is cheaper and tastier. But, this was the only place opened late. 

I never want dominoes again. It's just a reminder that corporate chains need to fall and get out the way. I rather pay for quality. Not preservatives and poison. 

Never Again!!! 

Calling card tomorrow to get refund! Waste of $30.
--------------------
I've taken a lot of spin classes over the years, and nothing compares to the classes at Body Cycle. From the nice, clean space and amazing bikes, to the welcoming and motivating instructors, every class is a top notch work out.

For anyone who struggles to fit workouts in, the online scheduling system makes it easy to plan ahead (and there's no need to line up way in advanced like many gyms make you do).

There is no way I can write this review without giving Russell, the owner of Body Cycle, a shout out. Russell's passion for fitness and cycling is so evident, as is his desire for all of his clients to succeed. He is always dropping in to classes to check in/provide encouragement, and is open to ideas and recommendations from anyone. Russell always wears a smile on his face, even when he's kicking your butt in class!
--------------------
A truly delightful find! This is the transformed Carrow's Restaurant on Plumb and Kietzke that was saved by the wrecking ball by its beautiful redwood beams and fascia. The food was fantastic. My wife had the tri-tip salad -- greens on one side of the plate with a balsamic vinagrette balanced by four good-sized slices of medium-rare tri-tip and potato "croutons" --
little heavenly bits of crunchy potatoes. I had the tri/tip/chicken combo, selecting the fresh corn salad and potato salad as my two sides. It was so good that we ordered dessert as well (not something I do regularly). The offering was lemon meringue, mudd pie, apple pie, and ice cream. We shared the first -- again delicious, with real, perfectly set and browned meringue. The prices were very reasonable for the quality of food and the experience. We've already recommended to family and friends locally, and expect to return soon. Well done!
--------------------
As a frequent customer who has come since the place opened, I had previously rated this place higher, based on a recent experience decided to downgrade.

Myself and both in-laws had visited, one of which was senior. Had a mail coupon for $5 off, which had no disclaimer.  I wanted to apply this to our party of three (2 adults, 1 senior). Cashier gave us a hard time stating that her management dictated that she wasn't allowed to apply the coupon if we were combining it with a senior discount. What logic is that? How would it be any different if I had paid for myself and my mother in law, applied the coupon. Then told my father in law, the senior, to pay on his own. Seriously, Retarded. 

This is on YOU management not that poor girl. Either for not creating a better customer experience or poorly training your staff.
--------------------
Beautifully sweet ending to a sweet trip to NOLA with the girls. We stumbled upon this after a delicous savory lunch nearby at Cochon (review to follow). Sweet Confections is on Magazine St, around corner from the art gallery strip on Julia St.   We had a sampling of cupcake (chocolate with mocha filling) and truffles (raspberry, creme brulee, and orange).  Cupcake was good, mocha filling best part. Rasberry truffle was my fav, love the dark chocolate so it's not cloyingly sweet. The coffee was a wonderful chaser, not overly burnt, smoky, or acidic... I usually have coffee with milk n sugar, forgot this time, but I didn't even need it!  Seating was nice, with a few cafe tables inside. Enough for our 6-girl troop. And service was great, helpful with flavor suggestions and labelling.  Gave 4 of 5 stars because maybe they could benefit from one more equally gracious staff person.
--------------------
Loved this tour! I grabbed a groupon and the price was great. It was the perfect way to explore New Orleans for someone who'd never been there before and didn't know a lot about the history of the city. Our tour guide had tons of interesting tidbits about the city, and I really enjoyed the experience. Highly recommended tour. I actually thought we were just going to tour through the cemetery, but she took us around the French Quarter for the first hour, and the cemetery for the second half of the tour. You'll meet up in front of a grocery store (seems strange at first, but it's not terribly hard to find, and it'll give you a chance to get some water), and you'll stop at a visitor center part way through the tour for a bathroom break if needed. This tour was one of my favorite parts of my trip!
--------------------
The best soon-dubu in the city!  This place is tucked away and once you walk in, it's like you've stepped into a Korean home.  Very welcoming, warm and inviting.

It's very vegetarian friendly!  The soft tofu is stewed and put into the dol sot pots which each and every stew feels like it's custom made for you. 

You can select from beef, seafood or mixed meats (seafood & beef), mushroom, and just plain.  They can adjust the spice as needed too.  I always get the extra hot with the hot temperature, can't beat it.  The rice also comes in a dol-sot which is great if you leave it in for a while, it burns the rice into a nice crispy shell.  DROOL.

Just thinking about this place makes my mouth salivate!  

If you're not into tofu, they also offer korean bbq meats (cooked in the back), with other soup/stew items.

Love this place!!!
--------------------
Another five-star dining review!  Fresco serves-up wonderful fresh and tasty pizza.  We tried this store as a change in our usual fare when we visit Tucson during the gem shows.  For what you get, their prices are very reasonable.  My husband and I were new, and the friendly young man behind the counter told us about their pizza, how it is made from all fresh ingredients, etc.  The restaurant was very clean and inviting.  We ordered the meat-special pizza, which included chunks of chicken besides the usual sausage, pepperoni, ham and bacon.  The pizza was GREAT!  Crispy AND tender crust, plenty of toppings, and a "multiple-napkiner."  We also had a nice talk with the young owner, and you can tell his business is his passion and only wants to serve the best and highest quality food to his customers.  We will definitely return next year!  Do I recommend Fresco?...YOU BETCHA I DO!!!
--------------------
i enjoyed the experience eating here and will definitely go back.

first of all, there are vegetarian options on the menu. we started with the veggie spring rolls which were hot, crisp, and delicious. my husband had the duck and rice vermicelli soup which we both agreed was great in a yummy, savory broth. i had the beef pho which i didn't care for because the meat was a bit grisly and i'm not a fan of tripe. i've not eaten a lot of pho and wasn't sure what to order, though. they offer several different beef cuts and i should have picked a different one. next time. also, the regular serving size was way more than enough. i don't think either of us could have come close to finishing the largest bowls.

the restaurant was clean and quiet with a sparse, yet very 80s decor. the server was quick and attentive.
--------------------
Don't let the outside fool ya or even the initial impression when you walk in because they food here is really good! When ya walk in this place it's like stepping back into the 1950's.  It's kinda awesome.  Definitely a small-town, homey feel that serves good ole family cookin'.  They had a iceskates up on the wall and a Christmas tree in the corner.  How precious.   
Don't come here expecting the best food in the whole wide world.  It is great for grandma's greasy cooking.  I've only eaten breakfast here but it's been amazing everytime.  I got pancakes and they are so fluffy and light and awesome (esp if you add a little butter).  The bacon was nice, thick, large slices; slightly overcooked maybe but super good cuz I love bacon! :)
The prices are reasonable and the service is great.  This is a great place for a quick delicious home cooked breakfast!
--------------------
For a seafood restaurant at the edge of pear expectations should be set high. My wife and I have come here 3 times now and ordered different plates off the menu each time. This last time we ordered cioppino, clam chowder, and a crab salad sandwich;
*Good - clam chowder (excellent flavor and consistency) would order again.
*Not great - cioppino (lacked flavor & a variety of sea food/lack there of) would not order again
*Pass - crab salad sandwich (lacked flavor, mayo was overpowering, crab flavor was almost non-existent, side of onion rings too greasy) - would not order again 
The overall experience is okay, better if seated outside right on the pear overlooking the ocean, inside is very small. Service is good but be prepared to wait a bit to be seated. 
Is it worth a visit? Yes, but be selective of what you order as the menu tends to be a hit and miss.
--------------------
My first trip to Susanna Foo was at 6 months old when the restaurant was still a hole-in-the-wall takeout joint owned by Susanna's parents. My parents have been taking my brother and I ever since. I have many fond memories of Susanna fashioning dolls for us out of the linen napkins and preparing Chicken with Cashew Nuts when we refused to eat anything else. The food has always been reliable, but now that I am an adult, I find it lacking excitement. The service is always impeccable and I have never been disappointed by the overall decor or ambience. I'd like to see Susanna improve upon some of her traditional recipes by either adding new flavors or perhaps returning to her Chinese roots with a more ethnic menu. I'm hoping there will be a revitalization and that I will come to love Susanna Foo as much as I did as a child.
--------------------
I'm glad that Michael & Lucy found a way to open up another family restaurant after years at Tony's on Linden (now closed following an ugly family dispute). The food is good and the prices are reasonable (ask about the slice and salad special). The Tuscany design is pleasant as are the owners (Lucy is always sweet and friendly). They have local beer on tap (Figueroa, Island Brew and others), 3 HD sports TVs inside, one HD sports TV outside for patio diners, a TV dedicated to surf videos and a TV dedicated to kids shows (and a classic old family friendly Ms Pac-Man game that was a hit with 2 kids when I was there). It's a tough location but I hope they make it work. Santa Claus Lane seems to be having a bit of a Renaissance after many years of being known mostly for outdated kitschy roadside attractions. Good luck!
--------------------
So our most recent visit earlier this month was very disappointing, however we received an email from the company's guest service, followed by a call from the Hermitage O'Charley's manager Chris who was very professional and apologetic about our experience and asked that we give his location another try on them. So I convinced my husband to do so. Here's how this 2nd chance went:: Absolutely wonderful. Chris asked that we let him know when we wanted to give the restaurant a second chance, but we decided not to. We didn't want any special attention. We wanted real unreviewed service.  We were seated in the bar because it was a very  busy night, regardless of that the server was very attentive and had a great personality. Our food came out in a timely manner, well prepared and delicious. We have since then been back several times and service continues to remain great.
--------------------
Hubby and I were eager to try this establishment due to a rave review from some close friends. We decided for our date night we would give it a try on Saturday. We pulled up about 8pm and the open sign was turned off. We thought maybe the light was burnt out or someone just forgot to plug it in. So we proceeded to the door. There were people inside and the sign said open till 11pm, so we walked inside. It was like walking into the Twlight Zone, everyone stopped and stared at us. The woman behind the bar came over and told us they were closed. HUH! Ok.... so we left. It was very akward and unpleasant. If they were closed then the door should of been locked or a sign on the door stating private party or something. 
Not sure if we will attempt to try to dine there again.
--------------------
Hilton properties are some of the oldest,  most dilapidated properties in the hotel business.  Additionally,  the customer service is the very worst overall with a few exceptions. 
Made a reservation here for 1 bedroom suite.  Suite wasn't ready.  Had a 12:30 lunch mtg  Needed to shower and change but suite booked wasn't ready.  What I thought was a courtesy extend turned out to be bait a D switch.  They gave e me a 'courtesy room' with the understanding that upon my return,  I would get the suite I booked. 
I  returned just to be to told that 'the room I booked had been sold.' Really,???? 
The suite was $250. The downside graded room was $235. I couldn't cancel the room and all of the rooms at a lower rate were 'sold out'  How is that possible so quickly? 
Fake apologies we're given,  but no satisfaction when more could have been done.   Never again.
--------------------
WOW!  What a fantastic place!  Food A+, Service A+++  We started with an appetizer of cheese curds served with a red pepper jelly.  LOVED IT!  I ordered the fish tacos and the wife ordered a beer brat for dinner.  We both thoroughly enjoyed what we ordered!  The portions were huge and priced just right for the portion size.  Our server was on it!  Very attentive and was very knowledgeable about the menu and made us feel very welcomed.  The manager stopped by and asked how everything was.  I let him know that I am pretty sure I have found a cool new place to hang out, have a beer and watch football.  He said they have great deals on game days and let us know about their brunch on the weekends.  Everyone said goodbye as we walked out and reminded us to grab a rootbeer candy on our way out.  I will be back!
--------------------
It's a good thing I've had a few weeks to cool off from my experience at Copabanana before writing this review or it might not have been pretty. Anyhow, I came during university city restaurant week and will never return. We sat outside and there were kids playing football right near the tables and being loud. We moved to the other side of the restaurant (still outside) and the kids made there way over to us and continued playing. We couldnt get away. We went to a table inside. Food was terrible. Steak was fatty and overcooked and mashed potatoes werent fresh. The waitress was about the only thing good about this place. She agreed on the steak and took it back. Came back with chicken as I asked for and it was like biting into rubber bands. All in all it was a disaster and I'll never return. 1 star for the waitress.
--------------------
Impeccable food and service! We figured if we were gonna do Sbraga, we needed the chefs counter 6 course with wine pairings. A pricy endeavor but no regrets. I loved having a front row view of the deliciousness about to be laid in front of me. The team behind the line on this particular Saturday night ran like a well oiled machine. 

The tone was set with the amuse Gruyere popover with foie gras soup. Heavenly! There were no duds on the menu, but other standouts were the saffron spaghetti with blue crab, the crispy Arctic char and the chicken liver mousse (btw I thought I hated chicken liver). The wines were matched very well. 

My friend was celebrating a birthday so I included that in the notes when making the reservation. To top off the experience, they gave her a note signed by Sbraga and a little goodie bag. Can't wait to return!
--------------------
We had dinner here after a long day at the convention center.  We asked to sit in a quieter area, and they found us a nice table in a side room.  Service was attentive and professional.  Our waiter recommended the aged ribeye steak--"best steak ever."  I didn't think I wanted an entire 18-ounce boneless, so he suggested we split it.  We did--certainly one of the "best steaks ever"--cooked perfectly medium rare and it was plenty for both of us.  Of course, we also had the signature shrimp cocktail (horseradish) and the iceberg lettuce wedge with crumbled bacon (very pancetta-like).   OK, iceberg wedge isn't the most exciting salad, but it's great when done well, which this was.  
   My only disappointment was a wine list that had a very limited choice of medium-priced wines by the bottle, so wine selection took a while.  A small complaint, so I would rate H & I  4.5 stars if possible.
--------------------
This small little donut bakery is located in one of Hermitage's oldest shopping centers! 

I can imagine baking donuts is a hard job, let alone running the business...it's one of those jobs that starts in the wee hours of the morning so that the donuts are freshly made daily!

Yeu, the owner, serves not only your common popular donuts, but he also serves donuts with bacon on top, apple fritters, pigs in a blanket, breakfast pastries, and  kolaches....in addition to these yummy treats...he makes doughssants....they are what seems to be a scandalous marriage of a donut and a croissant...!!!!!!!! Need I say more? Yeah...you heard me. A doughssant! Worth the trip just to eat one of these! 

Prices are considerably cheap! The doughssants are only $1.99 each! The regular donuts are about $.60 each! 

These sweet donuts are my favorite treats to buy for my kid's school teachers...and they love them! 

Coffee also served here!
--------------------
They sat us within 5 minutes and then took 40 minutes to even bring out sodas. The table next to us had the same server and got their good before their beverages came out. After almost an hour there with no drinks we tracked down a manager who told us our good never even got entered. I'm on my honeymoon and the friend we were there with had a date to make. Appetizer was the only thing to make it out and was decent boneless wings. Even with the manager begging us to let her get our food together free and not walk out, the service was beyond dismal and slow. First and last time coming to a Beef's. Made us all late. If we had waited at our table for the food we would have made our year anniversary before it came out. Better choices for food elsewhere. Avoid this place at all costs
--------------------
I think if I could, I would give Zen Yai a 3.5 stars, but alas, c'est la vie. 

The prices for their curry are excellent, at less than $12. Zen Yai is a tiny place, which is both good and bad. Good if you don't have to wait, because it is nice and cozy, but bad if enough people eat here on a given evening -- because you may just have to wait a while.

I like the decor a lot, and the use of colors. The tables and plates are full of refreshingly bright colors. 

The service was fine, and the food was at our table in no time.

My Pineapple curry was excellent! And the rice is served in the shape of a pyramid, which is fun. 

All that being said, my girlfriend had a less than pleasurable experience. She is a seasoned green curry lover, and was disappointed with their green curry offering.
--------------------
This tour is one to take when you want to have a lazy day, but you want to do a passive activity.  Me & my friends didn't wan the lunch, we just wanted to take a tour of the Mississippi.  The cost was average - around $28.00.  Con:  Remember it is a tour, so they have the typical tourist traps - photographer - me and friends declined that option.  

I would suggest if you aren't going to eat - to pull out your smartphone and research the Natchez Native American Tribe who inhibited the area prior to the colonization of the New Orleans area - interesting "tid bits of rituals", so that made the boat ride more fun because I became the secondary tour leader to my group.  If you are in the mood-go get a drink and this will comfort you as you learn more about the area on a steamboat.  Not a bad way to spend a few hours.
--------------------
My18 year old daughter had a severe soar throat. We had seen another fast clinic in a CVS. A few days earlier and recieved a miss diagnosis of a fungus infection. She was prescribed an oral medication that made the condition much worse. We were the only patients at this clinic the entire visit and it took us over 1 hour. The staff were very robotic like in there behavior. I tried to ask a question on the way out and was told I was not aloud to be there. Very strange since I was already there. It felt like I was being hurried out the door. Keeping in mind there were no other patients in the facility during our visit I was confuses about the wait time and gruf  behaviour. I found the experience to be very unfriendly. It is best to have a good primary care physician and avoid these places at all cost.

Drum-roll please! Review #100 coming right up! 

I chose to review Starbucks as my 100th review because it is a guilty pleasure. Something that I only allow myself once a week. But something that I crave everyday! 

This particular Starbucks is great. The baristas are always friendly and welcoming. The drinks are made correctly and quickly. I usually go with a Salted Caramel Hot Chocolate or Mocha. I also occasionally order the White Mocha. If you can't tell, I enjoy coffee that doesn't taste like coffee! In the summer their iced teas are the perfect thirst quencher! Their breakfast pastry items are always delicious. Try the Cranberry-Orange Scone and you will not be disappointed! Their breakfast sandwiches are unique and pretty tasty as well.

I always choose to go in and place my order over sitting in the drive thru. The line for their drive thru is always ridiculously long. It's usually quicker to go in!
--------------------
Meh is all I can say for TDS. The restaurant itself is just cold.... not literally, but figuratively. There was no decor, no menu boards, stainless steel prep tables as dining tables, no soda machines, staff EVERYWHERE with no identification (shirts, nametags, etc). The food is reasonably priced and most of it was quite good, but what really irked my party was the fact that they charge for extra salsa!!! We ordered a salsa trio (which included 3 samples of the various salsas, in 2oz glass prep bowls), and when my brother asked for more salsa for his tacos (mind you, we ordered one of ever taco, three burritos and guacamole), he was told he'd have to buy the trio again! Really!!??? We spent over $40 on food, drinks and apps, too. Even though the food was decent, I wouldn't return as the atmosphere is just blah and you can't get extra salsa for your damn tacos!
--------------------
fuck yes. meat, bourbon libations, and a salad (to round things out aka make myself feel better about ingesting the aforementioned two items.) i took myself on an early birthday date with myself and was not disappointed (neither in the food nor the company). i had a medium rare plain burger to see if it was worth all the fuss...no cheese, bacon, dressing, etc to disguise the quality of the meat. (of course, no bread either since i'm gluten free.) the burger was great - perfectly cooked and seasoned... though, i felt like a bit of a freak sitting at the bar eating my burger with a knife and a fork. i'd like to come back to try a fancypants burger since the extras look pretty tasty.  the salad was so-so; it was no frills with the perfect amount of dressing. the bartender-cum-waiter was super attentive but not cloyingly so. he made delicious sazeracs to accompany my repast.
--------------------
This place is so cute. The interior is adorable and casual. There's some small booths and chairs and tables for hanging out and enjoying your food/drinks. It's all so clean, too, which is a huge plus.
There's a little section with baked goods, some Asian and some more American. They have mostly Vietnamese food, but I also saw some other types of food (e.g bulgogi).
I came in with two friends and the woman who helped us was really personable and friendly. We ordered banh mi and boba tea, and sat down waiting for our food to be brought to us. The banh mi was really yummy, especially the bread. I had boba milk tea, which was as good as any milk tea I've had before. 
They have a drink card which you can get stamped to receive a free tenth drink. Definitely an incentive to return. Also, their hours are awesome, which is a huge plus.
--------------------
It's just a place to get my mail. 
It's about $250.00 per year for a little box.  it makes sense for us because we travel so much.  I don't want any important mail being delivered to my house.  
I have a door key to the store so I can access my letter box after hours.
My larger parcels are kept in the back.  I get a phone call every time I receive one.  
I would rather ship out my parcels using Fed-ex because they are cheaper and more reliable.   
My husband has used their printing services and is happy with them. 
I see packaging materials and other stationary goods for sale, but I prefer to use Canada Post for that.
No problem with the staff.  They are cheerful and helpful.  They know me well.
The strip mall location can be a little sketchy.  Some druggies and homeless people like to hang out at the neighbouring store fronts.
--------------------
Ordered curried chicken, teriyaki, and some eggrolls with soup...I never got that order

This was my first and last time ordering food from here. Delivery was quick, I'll give them that, but the order was wrong. When I called in they said I can have a free meal on them for the mistake.

I said, okay "I want that free meal now" (they also offer free delivery for orders over 12.00$) my food came out to 14.87$, 18.87$ with tip.


They refused multiple times (like it'll make a difference if they bring it now or tomorrow, either way it was a lie to get me off the phone). I informed her that if she didn't send her delivery guy back I'll dispute the amount paid to them with my bank, and they'll lose a new customer. 

Normally if one thing in my order was wrong I wouldn't mind at all. It's because my entire order was Wong...
--------------------
First time at Butcher & Bee with my husband who joined me and my co-workers for lunch one day. I love the place, it so cute with the farmhouse feel. It's really open and cute booths that offers some privacy. We had a group of 7 and it was a bit tight, but we were able to be sat right away. I ordered the pork belly gnocchi, and it was good, but not great. I felt it lacked texture. If the pork belly was crispy, it would have sealed the deal. My husband ordered the trout sandwich, unfortunately, he was disappointed that it was basically a 'tuna salad' sandwich. He did not enjoy it. For dessert, we ordered coconut macaroons, which were good. Co-workers had mixed reviews, but one ordered the KFC (Korean Fried Chicken) sandwich, and he liked it. Will definitely have to give this place another try. Also, the use books for bill holders, so cute!
--------------------
Great atmosphere and decor. Super friendly staff seat you right away. I stopped once for lunch and one time for dinner. They have some lunch specials one of which was Pad Thai. I order with chicken as the protein but they have the typical options for this .  The portion was good for lunch and had good flavor.

For dinner I ordered the chicken satay to start and the Panang Curry with chicken for main course. I was very disappointed in the satay being that you only get two small skewers. The flavor and peanut dipping sauce were very good but they give a few more skewers.  The Panang was good and you get a good size portion of rice.

On a side note, I was disappointed they do not have Pad See Ew. Still some other options on the menu I will return to try.

The staff and manager really know customer service.  Look forward to returning soon!
--------------------
I have been going to this nail salon for years off and on. I came here back when it was called Tropical Nails and Tom was the owner. Now its Grant Nails and has a different owner. When I started getting my nails done again I lucked out and found an experienced technician named Amy. I stuck with her because she did good nails. Then about 2 months ago Amy left. So I let the owner Angela do my nails. The first time was ok. Then the second time she did them the gel polish (which she talked me into getting instead of regular polish) started to chip within a day. I called and complained, she redid the polish and again within one or two days it was chipping. Now my nails look at mess. I don't trust her to correct the problem. Unfortunately, I'm going to have to find a new nail place. Very upsetting and disappointing.
--------------------
If you are going for the food, I would give it 5 stars, but since this is a brewhouse, I only gave it 3. 

I ordered the light flight since we went for lunch and I wasn't looking for a heavy meal. The beer was OK at best. It was bland, a little strange in after taste and uninspired. Light beers dont have to equal tasteless. My boyfriend had a "hoppy beer with citrus undertones". He could taste neither the hops or the citrus  (disclaimer - we are from VT and are used to very hoppy beers!)  

Now the food - that was great. We went at lunch time and was able to get a soup and salad for 8.95. We both had the same thing - Chicken Bruchetta salad and French Onion Soup. The portion was fantastic for a lunch size and the soup really flavorful! 

For a lunch downtown it was great, but I would go for the brews...
--------------------
Wings Wings and more Wings!  Chatham Tap is my favorite place to get wings in the Indianapolis area.  They are meaty, the sauce is great, and I usually always have to take some home for the next day.  I went with a fairly large group and got to sample different things on the menu.  I highly recommend the onion rings!  They have a large selection of beer as well.  Since I heard they were a "soccer bar" I did not know what to expect when I first arrived.  However, the atmosphere is great.  It is full of fans of all different sports and the staff is willing to show whatever sport you want to watch on TV.  The service was excellent.  No one in my group had to ask for one thing while we were there.  I highly recommend this place to anyone who is up for a great meal, great service and a great time with friends.
--------------------
Very cozy place to have a drink with friends.  The drinks were tasty and were served in very pretty glasses reminiscent of those some of our grandmothers had in their china cabinets. On the downside, all of the drinks seemed to have some combination of ginger, lime, and honey with the main difference being the kind of liquor you wanted in your drink.  So the choices felt limited.  I ordered the bacon wrapped dates, and have to admit that I was choking them down because I was hungry.  They tasted like they were double dipped in sugar.  Also, once another 10 or so people came in, it was very hard to hear each other because the noise level skyrocketed, which is surprising with so much fabric in the room.  The servers were nice and left us alone except to check on us every so often.  I don't recall being offered a second drink when my glass was taken away.
--------------------
After going there several times going to Fresh I am sad to report my last visit was not up to par.  I went with a group of people and the service / product was not how it used to be and the price was outrageous to say the least.  I entered and was not greet by the staff  and I do understand that the group I was meeting with was taking up most the inside of Fresh, but a little acknowledgement would have went a long way.  Also, I ordered the Vienna Latte with an extra shot.  It not only was one of the worst espresso based drinks I have ever had, but it was EXPENSIVE $7+ for a coffee?!?!  After realizing the price for the drink I was put off by ordering any products.

I really love Fresh and obviously from prior posts I do praise their products, but this time it was one of the worst experiences I have had.
--------------------
This is a fabulous gym.  Considering the cost, it provides a lot of fitness opportunities. I look for a gym that has a lot of classes at various times so that I can fit in exercise before or after work. As my work start and end times change from day to day, though, I need a gym that has classes at various times throughout the early morning and mid to late afternoon.  I found that the class schedule here meets that need. The trainers are excellent.  The spin and row teachers are really exceptional.  Try the We-Fit class, but expect a huge challenge, even if you are fit.  The facility is very clean, but this is a new enterprise, so time will tell if the business will continue to keep things clean and fresh.  I love that the women's locker room contains a blow dryer and extra hair ties.  These little things make a huge difference. Thanks for thinking of them.
--------------------
Went there on a Tuesday with my minivan, which ended up being Senior Discount Day. They didn't tell me before I paid that they won't clean or vacuum 3rd rows on Senior days. I got the Super wash, which included wax. They handed it over with large dirt smudges on the side, like it hadn't been wiped at all. A couple cup holders were barely touched and Some not at all in the front. The rest of the vacuuming wasn't good, with paper scraps still on the floor. I talked with the manager about the 3rd row and why didn't they tell me upfront when I pulled in. He said, "I won't do your 3rd row on Senior Day. That's the way we've been doing it for 15 years." I said I was new to the area and he said, "That's too bad." What kind of customer service is that?!? I usually don't write reviews, but this place was that bad.
--------------------
Square 1682 is a hotel bar I frequent. I've been there for lunch, brunch, dinner and happy hour. The food is great, the service is excellent, and the space is upscale. There is always a nice group of people that go there. Whether they are staying at the hotel or live or work in the area, you'll always find someone nice to chat with at the bar. The very best thing about the bar is the bartender that works on Mondays. His name is Dan and he is the man! He's my favorite bartender in the city and I've been to a lot of places. He always knows just what I want and remembers my name when I go there. The only reason I go to Square 1682 on Monday's is because Dan is working. If I walk by and he's not on, I keep going. He's that good! Love him and have so many great memories at this fine establishment.
--------------------
You think Value City, you think cheap value, right? Wrong! 

Think Rothman prices with Ashley Furniture pieces. Not a Broyhill in sight. 

Negatives:
- Entertainment centers and TV stand selection is small, and over priced selection.
-Their "Clearance" section is laughable and not much of a sale. No one is going to pay $299 for a nicked up coffee table that was originally $350. Go lower. 
- Sectionals by themselves average around $1,000 by brands I've never heard of. 
- The staff hangs out like a clique chatting in the middle of the store rather than helping customers. 
-Dining sets are nothing special and overpriced as well. I've seen the same selection everywhere else at a lower price. 
-5% military discount? Ooooh you're going to knock $20 off my sofa! 

Only Positive:
-They have a few modern pieces. 

Overall:

I think they're high for low quality-mediocre furniture. Shop around town. Or if you do find something you must have here, wait for a holiday sale.
--------------------
Yes, it's a little pricey, but it was darned near worth it. 
It certainly didn't seem a priority to get us our menus, but once they did, the service was pretty on point. The bread was good. I ordered a chopped salad and a crab cake, and the hub got a crab cake sandwich with fries. We had water to drink, no appetizers-walked out for $45 with tip. The food came quickly.  My food was great-and I'm no salad eater. The crab cake was quality, fries were good. 
Another drawback is that we had to sit in the bar area bc it was after 9. The table was the size of a chair, 3 plates were too much.

P.S. i used my bank card, and noticed that I was charged significantly more than I agreed to, so I called the restaurant. The manager said it's a banking glitch, and should correct itself before the money comes out of my account... It better.
--------------------
This place has a great location for the hungry tourist. It manages to be edgy yet chill at the same time. My reason for stopping in was to try the ahi fish tacos with avocado relish, which sounded awesome. At around 3 there was still a healthy amount of people attesting to its popularity and eatability. They had a selection of local microbrews (bottle, not draft) for those interested in getting a taste of Philly in beer form. Alas, I ordered my tacos, but had a little Scooby Doo moment when the arrived. Somehow the chef decided that it was okay to put such a delicate fish in premade taco shells...enough to makes this SoCal girl wince a little and question whether I should consume. Luckily the flavor of the fish was great. I only saw one half inch cube of avocado, but at least the sauce was yummy! 
I got a glimpse of the brunch menu...looks pretty tasty I must say...
--------------------
Couldn't say it better than the below poster. Excellent food, service and prices.

Located where Mugshots used to be (RIP), one of my coworkers had been raving about this place, in particular the falafel and of course the very kind owner.

Went with my pre-wife and we shared beef gyro (carved) pita, falafel pita and hummus plate. Everything was extremely fresh (I concur on the crisp lettuce) well seasoned and just plain delicious.  A lot of food as well and complimentary baklava. We took our leftovers home (I wrapped the two remaining bites of my gyro - it's that good)

I highly recommend this place and you'll definitely walk out with a smile. I think this spot is still relatively unknown and I very rarely post reviews. This is a unique spot to Manayunk and I will be referring all of my friends as I really want the restaurant to succeed - because the owner deserves it and of course for my selfish appetite!
--------------------
Pretty bummed I didn't try out the Catbird Seat, because this place was totes underwhelming. When you enter, there is a large, awkward entrance and you have to go upstairs to be seated. It was probably only half full, but since it was strange weather, we decided to sit indoors. I'll just say again, walking up towards the hostess as she watches you approach just feels....weird. 

Our server was nice, and we joked with him about the silly flower in a very knock-over-able vase. We got two drinks--julep and one of their other ones with gin, both of which were utterly average to bad. 

The crowd was sort of stuffy. The bread was blah. The food was pretty forgettable. The tenderloin was good because it was a good cut of meat. The Amish chicken was pretty average, with a not so flavorful and slightly MSG-y twang jus. Their signature grits was underwhelming as well. 

All in all, stuffy and so overpriced. Bummed out!
--------------------
I love this place. It's been in La Cumbre Plaza for I don't know how long now. If you are looking for a good sandwich look no further. All of the ingredients taste fresh, and their bread rolls are amazing. They are nice and soft, not with that cut the roof of your mouth crust. Being born and raise in Santa Barbara, actually just down the street, I have been coming here for some years now. I've tried probably over half of their sandwiches and all have been good, so good it's hard to pick a favorite.  In addition, I cannot forget to mention their awesome soda selection, so awesome I cannot hesitate to try something different with every visit. You won't find anything super fancy or exotic, like a roasted duck pastrami sandwich here, but if you're a local or just passing through and feel like having a great sandwich with good fresh ingredients swing by Plaza Deli and grab a bite.
--------------------
West Ave. Grill- Its a happy place in Jenkintown with a lot of locals eating outside under umbrellas with their dogs at their feet and kids on their lap.  Inside their is a large and small area with a bar to eat and look past the parking lot to nicer part of Jenkintown town square.  The wait staff is always nice and the owner is often around to talk to.  Free dum dum lolly pops at the counter as you walk out and news papers to read if you are eating alone or want to check in on the Phillies.
Food- always good. Great pancakes that are fluffy and crispy on the edges.  Kansas City  is a great breakfast too- for the most part great.
Big salads could have more Stuff in them- more of the things that are supposed to be there- as described etc.  But a complaint is readily heard and they always try to make you happy.  It's Nice- try it.
--------------------
For a long, long time, Dallesandro's was my philly cheesesteak haven.  However, since their change in ownership, they've gone steadily downhill.  Chubby's and Mama's tided me over until I could find suitable replacement.  Thanks to Larry's Steaks, I've rekindled my passion for cheesesteaks.

Larry's Steaks, situated by St. Joe's University, offers the closest thing to the original Dallesandro's cheesesteak I've found.  The meat is sliced and minced into tiny little pieces, maximizing surface area.  Then the cheese is melted throughout so it covers most of the steak and ensures a heavenly consistency and flavor.  The onions and mushrooms are up to snuff as well.  It's greasy enough to slide down your throat but not so much that it's a mess to eat.  I can't attest to the other menu items, but that hardly matters.  If you are up for a real philly cheesesteak, skip pat's and geno's (and the whiz, i can't believe people actually eat that stuff) and pick up a Larry's steak.
--------------------
Bought my beautiful new bike from this shop a few weeks ago then promptly crashed it (curse you, trolley tracks!). I brought it back to the shop this afternoon to see if there was any way they could try to fix the front basket, which was pretty mangled, and to give the bike a once-over to make sure it was safe to ride. I was expecting to have to leave the bike with them for a few days, but the whole process took less than a half hour. Not only did they fix the basket (not perfect, but pretty damn close), but they also fixed the gear shifter that was a little out of whack... FOR FREE.  I couldn't believe it. 

I also want to note that everyone in the shop- from the owners, to the sales people on the floor, to the mechanics, to the dog that greets you at the door- is so friendly and welcoming. I am so happy I found them.
--------------------
After moving to the area, Jungle Prada Tavern was one of the first places a friend took me.  The bartender made a great recommendation based on a beer I told her I liked and I loved it!  Now for the food- I LOVE seafood, so I am leary of ordering from places that don't do it justice, but alas, they impressed me thoroughly with all the seafood options I chose!!  The scallops prosciutto app, del mar pizza with crab and scallops, and crab stuffed portabella app (comes with a crab and lobster bisque- YUM) are all delicious!!  I also love the roasted portabella app- for a vegetarian option, it is delicious and was recomended by someone who isn't. I've actually gone back several times since then just to eat (obviously, I also drank ;) and took my sister when she was in town visiting (and is a seafood fanatic).  So all in all, give this place a chance!!  You will not be disappointed with the options!
--------------------
Monthly lunch with my fellow colleagues the other day and the person assigned to get lunch ordered from Fresh and had it delivered. 

My selection was the Chopped Italian salad. The salad consists of mixed greens, salami, smoked turkey, tomato, garbanzo beans and parmesan cheese served with the house vinaigrette. The salad was lacking for me. I think such a salad would be so much better with a few more Italian-esque ingredients in it, perhaps a little more anitpasto like. I know, it's not advertised as antipasto but c'mon....this salad was boring.  Throw in a couple of olives, some artichoke hearts, some sliced pepperoncinis. Maybe my tastebuds were having an off day but the salami wasn't very flavorful either. Charge a couple dollars more for a more inventive salad. Please!

I do want to give them another chance since so many reviews on here are glowing. Maybe I need to stick with a panini or something but I really do love salads for summer lunches.
--------------------
Is there any way that I can give a sixth or even seventh star to this place? Perhaps I'll contact the Yelp! corporate offices in San Francisco to inquire about expanding the star system using Lou and All About Hair as the Exhibit A. I've been on a three year odyssey, which has included some of the worst haircuts and barbers this side of, well, anything, to find a place like All About Hair. It is simply fantastic. I was here early on a Friday morning and aside from doing an incredible to the follicles that rest atop my head, Lou provided fantastic conversation and an environment that was more than inviting. I haven't written a Yelp! review in a very long time, but after my experience at All About Hair, I felt compelled to fire off a five star review about this gem of a place. Needless to say, I've found my barber of choice and they've made a long-term customer out of me.

During the parents' visit,  dad wanted some southern food. We tried Willie Maes, but the line was long and they weren't crazy about the area.  So we waited a bit and went down to The Praline Connection. Dad was in heaven. He's been talking about the food since we left. Dad got the taste of soul platter pictured below. He said the fried chicken was the best he's had and he had not tasted red beans and rice like that since he was a kid and my granny used to make em. Mom got the meatloaf with cabbage and lima beans. I got the ribs with potato salad and mac and cheese. My ribs were good but hard to cut the meat off the bone. I could've ate em with my hands but I didn't want a BBQ face. The potato salad was good but my mac & cheese was a little bland. The cornbread was great.  I'm going back next time for the fried chicken!

This is an updated review. I've been ordering from silver mine's at the same location for the last 4-5 years and they have only gotten progressively worse. Don't ask for anything to be added to your soup or chili; they'll charge you for the additions but will not include them in the order. They'll also most likely to include the free side such as the bread. It literally takes at least an hour to get your food delivered, maybe they should call Jimmy Johns and ask the what their secret is. This business is in major trouble with all of the other options available. The service is worse than if you had a bunch of kindergarteners running the business, at least they would be nice. You guys are right next to Eller Business School, why don't you ask them how you can improve??? Currently, this place is an embarrassment to their industry, and a waste of space on University Blvd. NEVER ORDERING FROM THIS PLACE AGAIN.

I love going to Phillies games sooo much and this stadium definitely adds to the experience. I was never a big baseball fan until about a couple of years ago, when my bf introduced me to the wonder that is the Phils- instant love. Sure,my first Phils game was the 10, 000 loss but whatever. The places has a open feeling, and never feels clausterphobic. The only time i've felt that I had bad seats was when we sat right under neath the scoreboard, and I had to keep on looking up.  I like how you can wander about and watch the game from the lower levels, and that despite it's a sold out game, it never feels cramped or you're really aching to get around the stadium. They have a lot of great food (lots of variety) and the facilities are always clean- both are numerous, so I'm never waiting in line.  I am missing baseball season and I cannot wait until April! Go Phillies!

This was our second choice after finding out Rio Mar was closed for Mardi Gras week. We had a hell of a time getting here since it was on the other side of the parade from where we were staying.
   Nonetheless, we had a great meal. 
    Service was spot on. Professional but not overbearing or obvious. 
    A little disappointed that they were out of two ingredients for one of their signature cocktails, but it WAS the day before Mardi Gras.
   The bread and butter at the table was excellent. Crunchy outside, soft inside.
   The beets salad was so much better and different from similarly named items at other restaurants. The greens literally tasted like they had been picked from a sun warmed field minutes before.
    G's Choucroute was a meaty fiesta. He loved it. My crab ravioli was lovely with a delicate Meyer lemon sauce. 
    Bread pudding for dessert was just how we like it - sans raisins.
    Truly a memorable meal. Way better than most hotel restaurants.
--------------------
Tried this place out after many suggestions from friends.  We went in one night about an hour or so before closing just to find that they were only serving a partial menu - we're not talking that late, it was like, 9:30 on a weekend.  There was no mention of going down to a bar menu on the website so I was a bit annoyed by that.  Something about 'surprise disappointments that could be totally avoided' really bother me.  So, the dish I had picked out online wasn't available and I ordered a burger instead.  The server seemed to have a very hard time understanding my burger and suggested that modifications couldn't be made?  I told him I'm sure removing a single topping wouldn't cause the kitchen staff any issues...  The rest of the meal we were generally ignored and the service wasn't great.  I found the food to be overpriced for the quality.  Unless there is a special reason to attend, I don't think we'll be going back.
--------------------
De vacaciones y sin ganas de cocinar, decidimos (x8) pedir pizzas en este lugar para retirar y comer en el lugar en el que nos estábamos hospedando, que quedaba a 500 metros. Así que, un jueves de verano, las fuimos a buscar cerca de las 21.30 horas.
Entramos y nos pareció muy ameno, limpio y confortable para comer ahí. Nos atendió un hombre muy amable y atento.
Pedimos los siguientes sabores:
- prosciutto (jamón crudo);
- ham (jamón cocido);
- pepperoni;
- cebolla;
- hongos;
- anchoas y
- albahaca y tomate.

Las pizzas tardaron 25/30 minutos. Todos sus gustos -de los cuales subo foto- estuvieron deliciosos. El estilo de pizza fue a la piedra, con salsa de tomate y queso muzzarela en una cantidad ideal.
Si bien este comentario parece limitarse únicamente a una estricta relación precio-calidad, no menos verdad es que, en mi opinión, la calidez con la que fuimos recibidos reflejó cómo hubiera sido el trato de haber decidido cenar ahí mismo.
No dudo en valorar a este lugar con cinco estrellas.
--------------------
Reading the reviews, I cannot agree with the others which tout the quality of the food. I had the dinner buffet and the food was mediocre at best. The selection was fine, though they do charge a higher price if you want crab legs. BTW- neither Easy Buffet nor Ginger Buffet charge extra for crab legs. The flavors were there, but the meats were dried out, concentrated, and fried foods soggy and tough as if the they hadn't been turned over in hours and were just sitting on the steam table.  

Service was very nice but slow, especially since there were only 3 tables going the whole time we were there.  I think they had him responsible for too many things other that waiting tables.  

There is a slim chance I'll come back since there are 3 other Chinese buffets in the area that I prefer over Dragon.  Perhaps if I do, there will be more guests to turn over the food and I can update my ratings.

Last May, my wife and I used Jump on the School Bus to take our wedding guests on a winery and brewery tour. They were just amazing, the perfect choice for our pre-wedding wine and beer tour and for wedding transportation between Goleta and the Circle Bar-B Ranch for our guests who stayed in town. Darin and Sierra did a wonderful job communicating with us in Washington, DC as we planned our wedding itinerary. They were flexible about trip times and made last minute adjustments when the number of in-town guests changed suddenly. 

Darin and Sierra have such attention to detail and quality that Darin even stopped by one of the wineries to meet us and to ensure that everything was as expected. Our driver was also extremely knowledgeable about the area and had many good suggestions throughout the day.

We couldn't have picked a better choice for a winery, brewery day tour and wedding day transportation than Jump on the School Bus! I highly recommend them to everyone!

I visited Jake's for the first time after learning that the small diner I used to go to in Delaware as a kid had become a franchise. I was so excited to experience the delicious burgers and fries that I craved as a kid.

I walked into the establishment and was frankly unimpressed by the ambiance. The restaurant was moderately clean and very open. The menu actually reminded my of a Five Guys. You get to choose your own toppings (all free) to put on 1, 2, or 3 patties.

I ordered the regular cheeseburger with a ton of toppings and a regular size french fry to share with my boyfriend. The burgers were delicious. The bread was soft and tasty and the burgers were succulent and juicy. The fries were disappointing. McDonalds fries taste better and usually aren't even as cold as Jake's were.

Man oh man, Jake's. I'll go back for the burgers, maybe, but I definitely will stick to the original location for a better experience.
--------------------
Spot on!

I got "the veg" and the spicy fries.  "The veg" is a portabella burger, with grilled mozzarella, picked veg, arugula, and gauc.  Wholly non-cow is this thing spectacular for a bella burger!  The bella is on bottom, then the mozzarella is directly fused on top of that.  I actually thought the cheese was halloumi at first because it wasn't super melted (a good thing). The gauc and pickled veg are slightly citrusy and vinegary, but are contrasted by the bitterness of the arugula.  There's a nice bun to contents ratio, and for bonus points it's a potato bun.

Wasn't sure what to expect with the spicy fries going in - are they hot sauce fries, etc?  Turns out they are of the crab-fries variety with some subtle other spices added in.  Nice portion - not too big.

The atmosphere kind of reminds me of a dive bar - I think that's the best way to describe it.  It's pretty small, so I wouldn't choose to ever eat in most likely.
--------------------
I really, really, really like so much about this hotel. For starters, it's BEAUTIFUL!!  Everytime I go to Reno, this is where I stay and I will continue to stay here when I go!!

PRO's:

1. The Spa is amazing! The staff working there are so friendly and helpful.The pools in the spa area are so clean. There were plenty of towels, water, juice, etc. 

2. The rooms were very clean and organized. 

3. The front desk staff was very nice and helpful. We didnt like the location of our room, so they moved us to another location with no problems.

4. They have a little diner that is there open 24 hours and has good food. Granted its a bit expensive, but it's a casino, what do you expect?


CON's:

1. The bathrooms in the hotel rooms didnt have fans, so when you're in the shower it gets so steamy, so fast!

2. We ordered rooms services and we ordered coffee as well, and they didnt bring creamer.
--------------------
LYING SCAMMERS. BAIT AND SWITCH. Will try and take advantage of you! Online coupon says 15$ for unlimited tanning any bed for a week for first time customers. Went to Chippewa location, The lady behind the desk acted like she had no idea what I was talking about. Then I pulled up the coupon and she said it's only for students and that I needed a student ID. However the coupon said nothing about this. Then she switched to saying the coupon is expired, yet it's still on YELP and they're website. She also said they won't honor the $75 for 45$ coupon you can literally purchase on yelp either. Just bullshit line after bullshit line. I then left And called creve coeur location and the lady there says, "yes you can still use that coupon, but you must go to the same location each time for that week once you choose a location." I knew this as my girlfriend used it last week. DO NOT GO TO THIS PLACE!!!!
--------------------
This place was cute and was in a great location!  It is one block up from the beach and wharf, two blocks over from State Street.  Parking was convenient, and our room was a King overlooking the courtyard and spa on the ground floor.  If there were people in the spa, they could be heard, but the noise didn't bother since the spa closed at 9pm.  The room was clean with a nice couch to lounge on, a refrigerator, a nice fireplace, ample closet and counter space, and a nice bathroom.  The wine and cheese at 5 was a nice touch as well.  Although this place didn't have a lot of extras, it was a pleasant stay, friendly and helpful staff, a good price, perfect location, and suited our needs just fine for a place in Santa Barbara.  My only complaint was that the room got a little stuffy, but was fine once we opened the windows and used the ceiling fan to air it out.  Would consider staying here again.
--------------------
It is unfortunate that with such a unique location and such a brand and product offering this specific store offers such lousy service. The wait is endless, no one is available to help and at Christmas time getting a gift wrap is act of God that requires endless wait. I bought gifts and knew that the wait for wrapping would be long SO I even left my items at the store to be gift wrapped at their leisure. They were not even moved from the counter where I bought them when I returned almost two hours later ready for pick up. This was a gift that needed to be given and The staff COMPLETELY "dropped the ball" on my time constraints! 

I love their stuff, but today was my last shopping experience at this location: couldn't get a gift wrapped after being assured that it could be done in a timely fashion???  I'll  cancel my card, do everything online and try not to go there if I can. It's really a shame!
--------------------
This hotel was fantastic. I was in town for a week, working at my company's PA office in Wayne. Great location and easy to get in and out. Hotel staff was very friendly. Room was immaculately cleaned and very spacious for just one person. Kitchenette was fully stocked with dishes, silverware, utensils, a small dishwasher and a full size fridge. Windows surrounding the king size bed were great- lots of natural light. I liked that opting out of housekeeping got me a $5 credit at the restaurant. 

The pool is small but no one was there the two times I went to use the hot tub. The bar has a decent drink selection, although I was bummed they were out of mint and couldn't make a mojito (which was on the drink menu). Burger was okay. Dessert was mediocre (but free with my $5 credit, so nbd). Omelet station was a nice touch in the AM. Coffee frequently had coffee grounds in it/was very weak, but the breakfast spread overall was nice.
--------------------
Had a great dinner at Spasso. My parents always request Oana and she is an awesome server-- answers questions, gives suggestions, and really knows the menu. We were quoted an hour wait, but were able to grab a high top in the bar area with no wait (they are full service).

Spasso is Italian, but has its own little spin; it's not just the classic dishes of a typical Italian restaurant.

They start you off with bread and this delicious eggplant/pepper topping that is so refreshing. I typically love oil for bread, but love this alternative.

I started with a Caesar salad which was perfect; just enough dressing, super fresh and I love the shaved Parmesan on top. For dinner I had pappardelle porcini which I think is the best item on the menu, it is thick pasta with sundried tomatoes, mushrooms and chicken with light sauce. It is totally delicious, and I had leftovers to have for lunch the next day.

Spasso is definitely recommended for a great dinner in Media!
--------------------
Ichicoro Ane gets lots of things right and the best part about it is the combination of the ambiance with the food choices and whiskey selection. I'm very happy with this location and the servers I have encountered so far have been helpful and pleasant.

The katsu is great and I highly recommend it to people looking for a more filling dish on the menu. The bao buns were also good for a lighter fish. I haven't had anything I really regretted trying, but definitely ask your server about the portion sizes of each dish since they vary across the menu.

The cocktail selection is excellent. I even had a special Japanese Old Fashioned last time which was a little expensive, but well worth it for some quality Japanese whiskey. 

I'm looking forward to exploring the menu little by little. The best way to experience this is in a group setting so you can try more things and it really reminds me of Izakayas or Japanese pubs I visited in Japan and Korea.
--------------------
I recently moved in a few blocks away from Henry's and was looking forward to having a neighborhood coffee spot not far from my house. So, on a beautifully humid August morning I walked over to check it. 

1) The atmosphere is pretty standard. Open space with the coffee bar in the back left corner and ordinary tables and chairs scattered throughout. No college coffee shop couches or armchairs but no industrial airbnb chic vibe either. Lacked uniqueness. 

2) The name Henry reminds me of Thomas the tank engine. Was there a train named Henry on there or not? If so, was he chill or not. Could add one star for chill train association. 

3) The coffee was not good. I got an iced coffee (STFU) and it was super bitter. The amount of ice in it wasn't obscene so it had that going for it but other than that idk.

I'm coming back to try some hot coffee or espresso on a cooler day but damn Henry :((( not a great first impression.
--------------------
*note* I wrote a similar review on tripadvisor.
I really wanted to like this hotel- it was charming and in a great location, with cute, unique rooms. It was just my style. Unfortunately, some blood-sucking insects ruined that.
Yup- bed bugs. We found them the morning we were leaving, because they normally come out very early in the morning (we were up at 530). Bleck! The management let us stay as long as necessary to take care of the issue (ie throwing away a bunch of our stuff and bagging the rest in ziplocks to be boiled) but it didn't change the fact that it was gross and a huge inconvenience. I threw away about $300 worth of clothing, shoes and luggage and I'm still worried that we brought the creatures back to our house with us. 
I would never stay here again, and I would urge you to think twice about it. Without seeing every carpet and mattress in the place replaced, there's no way I'd trust that the bugs were gone.
--------------------
A friend of mine took me to this little jewel near Dale Mabry and it was a great time. Its a small place with under 12 tables and a sushi bar. The bar seems to be the place to sit for the entertainment value. The sushi chefs (and owner) are pretty chatty and always say hi to everyone that comes in. It has a very friendly feel. We ended up at a table because the bar was full. I had pretty average fare in a spicy tuna roll and a rainbow roll, a couple pieces of yellow tail, and 2 pieces of Wahoo. It was all done very well! Super fresh and tasty. The sticky rice wasnt all that sticky and I ended up with a bowl fill of soy sauce and rice by the end of it, but that Wahoo...whoa....that Wahoo!! Just try it and you wont be disappointed. I spent about $30 for dinner which was a fine price for what I got and I will certainly be back for more!
--------------------
This place sucks! The one up on oracle and wetmore is where I usually go, however, I moved and the university location is closer. Sorry Silver mine you have lost my business forever.

First, I ordered two sandwiches a large homesteak  with no green onions. I accidentally typed onions instead of peppers that come on the sandwich. These bozos still proceed to put the greens on it and the manager laughs it off like no big deal. 
Second, my hot homesteak sandwich was as cold as if had been sitting out for an hour. You guessed right it took an hour to get my food and then the hot sandwich was not wrapped in the proper wrapping to keep it warm.
Lastly, the employee got rude with me when I was checking to see what time my order would be done. He proceeded to scold me about how he only got it two minutes ago and it will be done when its done. Not how you talk to a customer buddy!

Goodbye Silver mine!
--------------------
Here's an update for my further Comcast experience. Our bill was increased to 250.00 a month. We called and removed some luxery items which brought our bill to 225.00 a month. Called 4 time a to see how we could get our bill lowered, as we have been a loyal customer for 14 years. "Nothing we can do" was all I heard. We decided to no longer be raped by this company and set up service with Verizon. Called Comcast to cancel once we got hooked up with Verizon. All of a sudden, they can do better and reduce my bill to 140.00 a month....which I would have been extremely happy with. Unfortunately, it should have been offered the four previous times I called.  I have Verizon now and have been quite happy with the installation, customer service, and overall product.  I wish Comcast would go under because they don't care about quality customer service. They could offer me a years free of service, yet I wouldn't take it on principle. Screw you Comcast!
--------------------
I stopped in for lunch one day after years of, 'I really need to try that place.'  I really like their layout.  They have an uncrowded floor of tables and booths and a lunch counter along one side.  The counter faces the cooks' area, which I like because the bustle of multiple grills, fryers, and prep areas serves as a good distraction, not to mention you get frequent interaction with the staff.  They were busy and getting everything done, but they weren't rude or frazzled, and I had a real sweet waitress.

I ordered the fried shrimp po boy dressed, and asked for a side of rebbeans instead of fries.  I almost had second thoughts on that because the burgers that they were cooking right in front of me looked and smelled so good.  I really have a difficult time resisting the grill.

The food was average and is what you would expect in a tourist spot in the Quarter.  They may get another star if I go back for one of them burgers.
--------------------
I was here a few times because my friends won free happy hours. When I won one, I sent in my guest list and tried to call them a few times to confirm. Neither of the people who answered the phone were friendly or helpful, and I never did get in touch with the woman in charge of happy hours. She never returned my emails or phone calls. When I showed up with my friends, they didn't have my name on the list and forgot that they even offered me a happy hour. It was irritating, and after some fighting, they eventually let me through.

There is a dress code (no sneakers, flip flops, hats, etc.), but I don't really mind. The bouncers and bartenders aren't very friendly and can be slow, and I never tried the food. The crowd isn't great either - attractive and douchey (maybe because, like us, they're just trying to get drunk and go somewhere else). 

Free booze is always good, but I wouldn't come here for any other reason.
--------------------
OMG!!! I can't believe this kind of service exists!  My husband called to make an appointment for full detailing for next Sat with Michael, he called again to confirm on Fri before we head there since it's a distance from our home.  Michael said he didn't know we wanted to do full detailing thou we specifically mentioned that.  He advised us to come the following sat instead.  We agreed and we reached there at 8am on the following week.  Guess what?  Nobody is at the workshop, it's closed!  We called him and he said he is busy and will call back.. We waited for half an hour in our car and there is still no call from him.  We headed for our breakfast and came back again at 9:30am hoping to give him another chance.  Here comes Alex, his partner opening the shop at 9:30am!  1.5 hours away from our appt time and still no sight of Michael.  Alex tried calling Michael and couldn't get hold of him.  We gave up!!! What a horrendous experience!
--------------------
This was my first time dining at Ava and I enjoyed most of it. We ordered the Ricotta cheese & toasted bread and although the flavor was excellent, I thought the bread to cheese ratio was off quite a bit. The ricotta came in a tiny ramekin typically reserved for flavored butters, so I expected more for an appetizer. 

The two pizzas split among a couple of people were the sausage and the potato with rosemary. They were both tasty but I think they forgot the Rosemary on ours. Still yummy, tho! Another entree was the grouper w/Israeli couscous. Scrumptious!

Dessert was a must and the zeppoles, or sugared donuts, were amazing. The cherry tart a little less so, but one person at our table loved it, so maybe it was just not my cup of tea. The cherries were a sort of candied cherry-interesting, but sweet with a very dense crust. Again, just not my personal fave. 

I will definitely return to try other menu items that looked great-like the pastas made in-house daily...that's next!!
--------------------
I have been going to this dive bar for years. Jonny's has a great happy hour everyday and it's very laid back. The food is always on point though. You may think that a dive like this wouldn't have the best options but you are wrong my friend. They make all of their dough from scratch and their naked wings keep me coming back every time. Their Jon's salad with grilled chicken is also a staple of mine along with their pizza.
They also offer games such as trivia and even bingo. They are all free to play and you win some great stuff like gift certificates and even 1 cent pitchers of beer! Can't go wrong with that. 
It is a smoking bar so be aware of that and it gets pretty bad when they are busy. It does get  crowded on game days or nights. Overall it's a great place to grab a few cheap beers with friends and a half-price pizza (did I mention they have 1/2 off pizza on certain days?)
--------------------
This place was amazing! I only tried their ice cream I really wanted to try the hot chocolate but didn't get a chance :(. Well the ice cream was great! The first night I came here I got a brownie sundae all for myself, brownie on the bottom and three scoops of ice cream topped with whipped cream and nuts. I finished it all happily! I chose pumpkin cake flavor which was delicious and smooth. I also got pralines and cream that was better than other praline ice creams. The Tennessee fudge was vanilla with fudge swirled it was good not too special. 

The next time I came I got nutter butter ice cream that was really good had cookie pieces in it! I got the hot fudge topping over it and that was a great combination. 

The service was great the workers were really nice and patient with me haha indecisive! They would joke around with me and let me sample all I wanted. Also no judgement for eating all the brownie sundae alone :) lol
--------------------
I still love this place just as much as I ever did, and here's why:

1) Super friendly and knowledgeable staff 
2) Roomy, with lots of outlets and enough space to accommodate mid-sized groups (like the recent Yelp Office Hours)
3) Delicious tea, of course!

I've always loved their "Awake" Fizz Tea, but I've also broadened my horizons to include Pearl Tea (aka bubble tea). The taro flavor rocked my socks off. It did take a little getting used to though, as I had a mini anxiety attack every time I took a sip. Because I got it warm, it was in a paper cup and I never knew when a pearl was making its way into my mouth. As a result, I spent half my drink wondering "is there one in my straw?" It's totally worth the suspense, though.

The only thing that still troubles me is the music. It's just...not right. In fact, sometimes it's pretty distracting. It's easily avoided, however; just bring headphones and your own musical selection and all is well.
--------------------
Went recently for a birthday party and it was certainly worth checking out.   Was my first time there and I was pleased for sure.  

Was nice and quiet as it was a Tuesday and the service was good because of that.  I'm sure it normally is though based on the size of the place.  

I had beef n lobster which both were cooked well and I was happy.  Also the mashed and asparagus that came with it were both very good.  

I wasn't to stoked with the appy we had which was these crab and cheese balls as they were very bland with little crab taste and no real seasoning it seemed.  Maybe just not for me but I wouldn't recommend those. 

Also had Creme Brule which was solid and is get it again for sure.  

Overall I'd say four due to a couple things like the appy and the shaky table, seriously so stupid to have that at a place that nice.  

But I'd gladly go again and would tell friends to try it.
--------------------
Despite being a spin-off at the burgers from Rouge, I actually think that the burgers here are, dare I say it, better then flagship restaurants.
Over the last year they keep expanding their burger and toppings options by editing the little placard next to the registers, instead of changing their giant menuboard every time  they decide to add a new cheese or vegetable you can put on the burger.

I've been here a few times, trying the 500 (lettuce, bacon, cheddar, special sauce) delicious, and also making my own combos with their Kobe Beef burger (I think its worth the extra few bucks). I like it with truffle cheese and grilled onions. The brioche bun also really makes these burgers something special.

Their fries are also extremely delicious. As a huge fan of truffle oil, I can never resist getting their truffle oil fries. When they come warm out of the fryer, coated in truffle oil, there is just no better taste known to man.

Most important of all, they are open late on weekends.
--------------------
Why don't we have a Target?  I thought K-Mart was going out of business.  Well not this one, this miserable son of a bitch refuses to die.  They had the audacity to try to update it.  It reminds me of Jack Palance its old, tired, and smells funny, but it ain't going know where.    I wish a shiny new Target would come along and stab this relic of a store through the heart with its superior retail sword.  I have experienced on no less than 5 occasions of a product being labeled as on sale only to be charged full price at the counter.  Then I have to stop the line to back to the aisle and grab the sign to show it to the cashier.  Once I bought a beach chair here, well my wife saw the dopeness of said chair and wanted to copy me.  I return to the store the next day (happened to be 80 degrees and sunny) and those SOB's raised the price of the chair $10.  I was pissed yo.
--------------------
My experience with Shalimar was nothing but wonderful. 
I wanted to get my engagement ring sized and was told over the phone that it could probably be done within the day. 
When I brought it by, the team confirmed that the jeweler would be able to accommodate my same-day request and that it would be around $40 (simple band, decrease by three full sizes).
I checked my size one more time, confirmed, and left to let them do their thing.
When I came to pick up later that afternoon, the ring was too small. It's very important to note that Shalimar sized the ring perfectly, but that I made a mistake and should've gone up a half-size.
The Shalimar group were completely understanding and accommodating, even resizing my ring back up and getting it back to me within an hour at no charge! Even though it was my mistake!
The associates' attitudes in dealing with what was a pretty embarrassing situation instantly earned my satisfaction and loyalty as a customer. Very grateful for such a wonderful experience.
--------------------
We got diverted to Tampa and decided to make the drive to Orlando but first we needed somewhere to eat. Wanting to avoid chain restaurants, yelp steered us towards this little local gem!

The ladies had the 7 oz. Tampa strip and the gents both had a 14 oz. ribeye. They grill their steaks over oak and citrus Wood and the smoky flavor is to die for! We are big fans of our smoker back home and cook our steaks this way as well, it's rare to find steak cooked over woodsmoke in most places and this was worth the side trip!  Sides were veggies and sweet potatoes. The wines on offer were so reasonably priced- most under $20 a bottle but a decent selection. They just don't mark them up 5x like most places! 

Our waitress Lisa also made great recommendations and her service was welcoming, friendly, and excellent. We are so glad we went local instead of to a chain. Bookmarking this place for a return trip next time I am in Tampa for sure!
--------------------
Yelp doesn't allow to leave 0 star review, so that is why you see one star. Me and my wife are moving from NY to South California, and we contacted 5 different moving companies. I sent my initial email to United Van Lines on 05/02/2018, and soon I got email back with Virtual Survey confirmation for 05/10. The lady that did virtual survey was very meticulous and professional and we "screened" through the whole apartment in 15 minutes. No one contacted me after that, so I sent a second email almost a month after, on 06/05 asking if everything is ok, and if I can get the quote. I don't need to mention that other 4 companies sent their quotes in less than 48 hours. Since no one replied til today, I called the direct phone and I left the message on the answering machine. No one called me back. I hope everything is ok, and that no one is hurt, because I don't see any other reasonable explanation why they are avoiding me. Very, very unprofessional.
--------------------
Returned to get a fill and pedicure a week after getting a gel polish change, once I discovered the cost would be over $85 I canceled the pedicure and only wanted a fill. Originally the owner was very nice and attentive but when she sensed I refused to pay their ridiculous price, she turned her attention completely off of me and showed absolutely no regard. She no longer cared for my business and she had no problem showing it. She even reassigned the nail tech to someone else bc I refused to be over charged for service. I asked why the original nail tech was no longer doing my fill, I got no answer. I looked over and saw the owner catering to customers that had just walked in. I sensed flaky business so I ultimately walked out without being serviced. Horrible customer service from the owner. I understand they use quality products but not everyone is looking to spend hundreds of dollars in a nail salon regardless of how "high end" it's self proclaimed to be!

Late one Saturday night, some friends and I made the mistake of trying to get drinks at Plough and the Stars and left very quickly. We were walking around trying to find somewhere else to go, noticed this unmarked bar and decided to check it out. We were so excited to see that there were so many great beers on tap, and there was a decent crowd there so we stuck around. It was a fun night! And after a few weeks of wondering where we had gone, we were able to find the Irish Pol on Yelp :D

I went back for happy hour recently and it wasn't exactly as I had remembered. It was pretty dark and dingy looking inside,  and the few people there were much much older. It just had a weird vibe. The beer was still great of course. The happy hour special was $3 drafts, but most of the beers I wanted weren't included. I won't be back for happy hour, but I would definitely stop in on a Saturday night!
--------------------
We visited this place because of its location on the wharf, and because my husband loves seafood. It's tiny, but we were there on a Tuesday evening, and only had to wait a few minutes. We ended up sitting at the bar; it would have been a longer wait for a table outside, since there are so few. Because of its size, it's a little noisy, but not bad. The service was very good. My husband had the crab sandwich, and wasn't impressed. It's served on very uninspiring white bread. I had the fried shrimp, and enjoyed it very much; it was not greasy or heavy, and the shrimp was moist and tasty. There is literally nothing but shellfish on the menu. So, the non-seafood enthusiast (me) was happily surprised to enjoy the shrimp so much (plus good onion rings), but the seafood enthusiast (my husband) didn't love the crab sandwich. If we tried this place again, he would order something else. The location is awesome, so if you like shellfish, definitely give this place a try.
--------------------
I met a buddy mine at this spot that I have always wanted to go to, but have never had the time. I walked in and sat at the bar. The police were investigating a burglary from the overnight it seemed some dirt bags broke in on a side door and stole a bunch of liquor from the bar. The bartender was great and service was prompt. I ordered a pint  of dark ale and my buddy and I split a order of wings. The beer was cold and the wings were very tasty. I remembered meeting the owners of the establishment at the last Italian Fest at the Farmers Market so I really wanted to like this place as they were very friendly folks. I will continue to patronize this spot as it was a great spot close to home and work. I also like the locally non franchised making it work attitude that this place gives. I really was very comfortable at this establishment and well tell the rest of fellow Yelpers to hit this spot!!!
--------------------
Harry's blue bell is a nice spot. We stopped a few days ago for a quick dinner. It's tucked in the corner of a shopping center and it's very easy to miss. It was packed and seemed like the place to be for locals. The inside is nice but small, only a few tables in the entire place. The service was just okay. 

The beer selection is very good as are the prices on the beer. The food menu was a bit limited with you're basic bar food. The wife went with the bbq pulled pork and I went with the chicken and honey mustard wrap. The bbq pork was good, the bun was nicely toasted but the sauce was overly sweet for our liking. The wrap was fresh and good but nothing spectacular. The fries were hot and crispy. The kale slaw was fantastic but a very small portion.

Overall it was a decent meal. I wouldn't go out of my way to go back. If I were in the area I'd stop though. Solid 3 stars.
--------------------
I love it!  The reviews were great and I was desperate for good carry out, so we decided to try Pizzaville (is anyone else picturing JT singing - Bring it on down to Pizzaville?).  The prices are a bit high, but the quality of the food is great!  The pizza crust is between a hand tossed and thin crust.  Perfectly crunchy ends and just chewy enough in the middle.  Good quality cheese and tangy tomato sauce. I ordered it with just mushrooms and they put on a lot!   I also asked for heavy sauce.  They put extra sauce on the pizza and even gave me an extra container of sauce in case I needed more. 

I can't decide which was better, the pizza or "breadsticks."  I say "breadsticks" because they were really more like garlic bread strips.  So buttery and garlicy, they were great even without sauce.  I'm ashamed to say I ate nearly the entire order myself.  

The employees are very nice and helpful.  The store is clean. I need to go back and try their lunch buffet.
--------------------
On a scale of one to things that are awesome, this place is the bomb. 

I was drawn in by the promise of the duckfat frenchfries. Took the boy for his birthday and put our name in, had a drink around the corner while we waited and were given seats at the bar after about 45 minutes. 

We were waited on by Keith, the bartender, who was congenial, knowledgeable about his whiskeys and an all-around cool guy. We started with 3 cape may salts (two for me, one for the boy) and tater tots, both of which made me happy.

For dinner, I got Kentucky Fried Quail (stellar, though the succotash was not as exciting as I wanted it to be) and the boy got the 24$ Fois Gras burger, which was incredible. Worth every penny. The duckfat fries were pretty yummy, but not even the best part of the meal. I could've done without the cheese sauce, but as it was on the side I wasn't deterred.

I look forward to coming back here, with everyone I know.
--------------------
So we've been wanting to try the sushiritos since they opened up a location closer to us and we finally tried it last Friday. 

I got the slammin' salmon and my wife got the crunch. I'd say they both definitely had fresh ingredients, and definitely tasted fresh, but I think the balance of flavors wasn't quite right for the slammin' salmon. Way too heavy on the sauce, completely overpowering the crisp fresh veggies and salmon. 

We tried the Japanese fried chicken. Sauce is a little sweet and sour. And the chicken was a little dry. 

We also tried their green tea and lemonade, which were pretty good, but you don't come to a place like this because their green tea and lemonade are their best things on the menu. 

Overall, you pay a high premium for a gimmicky meal. With this location being essentially at a revolving door of new customers on the corner of Penn's campus, I think they have the potential to do well. But I don't think I'll be coming back. We'll take our $34 elsewhere.
--------------------
This place is good~  The chicken is moist, the skin is crispy, the flavor is nice and smokey, this is the best kind of roast chicken I have tried. The smells (smokey, bbq) is so good and hypnotizing, just make my mouth water.  I got the double chicken family which is 2 whole chickens, literally a bed of fries underneath them, and cole slaw.  It was more than enough to feed a family of four.  The dipping sauces that come with it are also real good, i really like the mustard base one, its kinda mustardy with a chipotle flair, and there is also a green sauce that is like a salsa.  The fries are wedge fries and they make you real full because there are plenty to go around. We had leftovers because the meal was that big.  I would rather eat here than popeyes or kfc, because you get more, its healthier, and you get better service. The owners are real nice and friendly. I will be back because I know I will be craving this chicken.

I took an 8 year old and a 14 year old for the lunch special pizza.  We have done this on several occasions, and the kids love that they each get their own personal pizza, made the way they like.   They both ordered their pizza with 2 items and wanted BBQ sauce as the base instead of tomato sauce.  (this is the only way they enjoy pizza).   I was told that they could only get tomato sauce, not BBQ sauce.   I explained that we have gotten it this way several times before.   We were told that they don't offer it this way any more.   I see that some of the pizzas offer BBQ sauce and pointed it out, but again was told that it couldn't be made this way for them.   I asked if I could pay additional to have it made with BBQ sauce, but once again told it was not possible.   Sadly, we left the restaurant and chose a different nearby restaurant for lunch.  I'm sorry to say I won't be able to take the kids here anymore.
--------------------
After having been here, I would say that the food had great flavors for the taste buds and it was a unique experience.  Our server, Brian was no doubt a foodie... I've never seen anyone get so excited about food and discuss the ingredients in such detail with so much passion.  The food really was different and had unbelievable flavor.  Anyone who calls themselves a foodie should try this place.  I'm thinking they would be pleased with this place.  But, the portions were small.  And I really didn't like the interior of the restaurant.  I'm more of a booths girl.  Booths can be classy, you know?  All in all, I would say this was an interesting place and I would come back, but the dishes were too complicated for me to want to come back beyond once a year.  Speaking of timing, the chefs change the menu every year.  And these guys really are good at what they do.  The owners actually own the Red Pony and two other restaurants all on the same street!  And they're all doing well.
--------------------
Great community vibe... i've run into friends and struck up conversation with new ones each time i've been in.  Its nice to have new hang within walking distance of my house.  I've stuck to the classic burger and love it... everything from the buns to the ketchup is made in-house and has unique taste. The bar had pretty much whatever i wanted... last night the bartenders made some homespun watermelon concoction.

To touch on some other reviews... i understand everyone has a different experience, but to say the place is 'too hipster' seems like someones still jaded from feeling left out in high school...  and personally attacking the owner is tasteless and has no place in a review.  We should be glad we don't all have someone looking over our shoulder attacking our motives. I like what Burger Up is trying to do and i like that they hired a bunch of folks representative of our Nashville community... if you need a non-musician wait staff who dresses just like you and takes you to prom, you're probably in the wrong town.

Maybe I just had bad luck at this property but I am a SPG gold member... quickly approaching platinum and made a reservation at this property. I payed a good amount for my room and when I asked for a larger room they told me they where all the same. I asked did every room have adjoining doors and was told yes. I then told the front desk clerk that I could hear EVERYTHING going on next door including sneezing and even AC talking on CNN 360 very clearly. He told me to come down and get a new key and move to a room there was nobody in. They did not offer to bring me a key or help me move. When I got to the lobby the line was at least 10 people deep and there was only ONE person there. I just gave up and dealt with the noise and a few hours later they finally turned off the TV and I could sleep.  There is nothing fancy about this hotel and the service for sure needs improvement!
--------------------
I must say I'm very disappointed, my two stars are for presentation and prompt delivery. I ordered the rainbow roll, white tuna roll, calamari and chicken lettuce wraps. Where do I begin? ok with the bad. 

I strongly feel that when you are delivering food that should be served cold, you don't put it in a bag with hot food because that equals mushy, warm sushi, which is what I got. The rainbow roll, which normally is topped with raw fish was topped with mushy avocado????? which I ended up peeling off to salvage the sushi. The spicy white tuna roll was very good.

The calamari looked like chicken fingers all the breading was falling off and it was under cooked, I took one bite and tossed it. Now I've had lettuce wraps before but mines came with an actual head of lettuce in a bag and chicken filling in a plate. It was not described this way in the menu at all. All in all I don't think I'll be ordering from here again. I'll stick to Niji's on 5th.
--------------------
Like many other reviewers I passed by this place a number of times before looking it up on Yelp and realizing that I really did need to give it a shot...
Wow... I was not disappointed!
We started out with the crab cake appetizer- it was very well portioned (2 large crab cakes) and the sauce with it had an interesting hint of dill (just lovely and refreshing and a little different).
We were feeling like comfort food and had the chicken tenders-  The portions were very generous and the food was just solid.  Not fussy or stuffy or trying hard... just good, wholesome and good to eat.
The service was fine- however there is only one waitress for the tables and the bar, so i can imagine that if it is full that would cause some delays.  Overall it was just a lovely meal and the prices were unbelievably reasonable (most places have crabcakes 1/2 that size for twice that price)...
The ambiance is nice, nothing crazy but it is just a very nice option with reasonable prices and lovely food!

Milktooth is the place to go if you want a good breakfast cocktail and a twist on traditional brunch. At first glance of the menu, you may think you've never heard of any of these foods for breakfast, and you may be right. I guarantee no matter what you order, you're going to enjoy it. 

Milktooth is one of the most popular brunch places in Indy, which means you will typically have a wait. Trust me, it's worth the usual 30 minute wait (on weekends). To make it go by a little faster, they've got a walk up bar for their coffee drinks and pastries. Snack on one of those to give you a preview of the amazing meal you're about to have.

Their menu changes from time to time but they have a few things that stay one the menu but change ingredients. I love all of their variations on a Dutch pancake, and their raclette grilled cheese is to die for.  If you're making this a boozy breakfast, don't pass up on the michelada. And sit outside if it's warm enough!

I find it hugely ironic that WF is trying to reposition itself as a 'value' food store right now when others (i.e. Trader Joe's up the street) have been doing that for years.  For value, go elsewhere.  For pretty food, lovely store displays and a feeling of smugness, check out Whole Foods.

Despite my snark, I have to admit that it's nice to see an enormous, clean and well stocked yuppie market in Reno finally.  Now that this town has been rated by National Geographic as a top outdoors place to live in, it needs the retail to support that (and I don't mean another REI).  For myself, I'm too cheap to look seriously at this place for my regular shopping needs, but for lunch and the odd stopover, it's awesome.   Beautiful produce, drool inducing cheese selections and a bakery that would break my budget if I bought everything that struck my fancy.

Plus it's proximity to the freeway (for those of us who do our shopping based on distance from the 395 or 80) makes it an ideal stop to/from the airport.

Second stop for Center City Restaurant Week:  R2L, dinner for $35 each. 

On the 37th floor of Two Liberty Place is a very fancy-cool restaurant/lounge where you can get a bird's eye view of the city! Group of us went to dinner here together after a day of meetings. Didn't get one of the tables facing the windows, but still had great views of the sunset and city by night. Again, multiple choices for the three courses, but I chose to start with the crisp peas/ham/garlic risotto [balls]. Main course was the Butcher's Filet (braised short rib + Steuben bean chili, potato/farm veg slaw and basil), which was quite heavy since there was also meat in the chili as well. The dazzling dessert to finish it off was the milk chocolate + hazelnut pudding served with salted caramel and coffee to melt the chocolate, and candied almonds on the side. A bottle of wine for the table as well. Food was great, waiter was awesome (making sure to warn me that the risotto came in ball form rather than a bowl, for instance), very classy experience.
--------------------
I made my Yelp account for the soul purpose of reviewing this place; I think that very much speaks to how I enjoyed the experience. It's exactly what you would expect from a local cafe/coffee shop and then some. The food and coffee were great and the atmosphere was very friendly and casual. The architecture of the dining room was very cool as well - it had a very Victorian feel, which I personally love. The service was a bit slow, but the barista was the only person working behind the counter and she was also very personable, so for that we can forgive her. When I go to a coffee shop I usually go to stay and relax, often reading or sketching. It is the perfect place for that, with both indoor and outdoor tables, a booth, and a counter. I also appreciated the dog-friendly policy but that's definitely a personal preference and isn't right for everyone. The location is also great, being situated in the French quarter. My only complaint is that I could only visit once on my trip to New Orleans.
