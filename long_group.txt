Despite being a spin-off at the burgers from Rouge, I actually think that the burgers here are, dare I say it, better then flagship restaurants.
Over the last year they keep expanding their burger and toppings options by editing the little placard next to the registers, instead of changing their giant menuboard every time  they decide to add a new cheese or vegetable you can put on the burger.

I've been here a few times, trying the 500 (lettuce, bacon, cheddar, special sauce) delicious, and also making my own combos with their Kobe Beef burger (I think its worth the extra few bucks). I like it with truffle cheese and grilled onions. The brioche bun also really makes these burgers something special.

Their fries are also extremely delicious. As a huge fan of truffle oil, I can never resist getting their truffle oil fries. When they come warm out of the fryer, coated in truffle oil, there is just no better taste known to man.

Most important of all, they are open late on weekends.

Why don't we have a Target?  I thought K-Mart was going out of business.  Well not this one, this miserable son of a bitch refuses to die.  They had the audacity to try to update it.  It reminds me of Jack Palance its old, tired, and smells funny, but it ain't going know where.    I wish a shiny new Target would come along and stab this relic of a store through the heart with its superior retail sword.  I have experienced on no less than 5 occasions of a product being labeled as on sale only to be charged full price at the counter.  Then I have to stop the line to back to the aisle and grab the sign to show it to the cashier.  Once I bought a beach chair here, well my wife saw the dopeness of said chair and wanted to copy me.  I return to the store the next day (happened to be 80 degrees and sunny) and those SOB's raised the price of the chair $10.  I was pissed yo.

My experience with Shalimar was nothing but wonderful. 
I wanted to get my engagement ring sized and was told over the phone that it could probably be done within the day. 
When I brought it by, the team confirmed that the jeweler would be able to accommodate my same-day request and that it would be around $40 (simple band, decrease by three full sizes).
I checked my size one more time, confirmed, and left to let them do their thing.
When I came to pick up later that afternoon, the ring was too small. It's very important to note that Shalimar sized the ring perfectly, but that I made a mistake and should've gone up a half-size.
The Shalimar group were completely understanding and accommodating, even resizing my ring back up and getting it back to me within an hour at no charge! Even though it was my mistake!
The associates' attitudes in dealing with what was a pretty embarrassing situation instantly earned my satisfaction and loyalty as a customer. Very grateful for such a wonderful experience.
--------------------
We got diverted to Tampa and decided to make the drive to Orlando but first we needed somewhere to eat. Wanting to avoid chain restaurants, yelp steered us towards this little local gem!

The ladies had the 7 oz. Tampa strip and the gents both had a 14 oz. ribeye. They grill their steaks over oak and citrus Wood and the smoky flavor is to die for! We are big fans of our smoker back home and cook our steaks this way as well, it's rare to find steak cooked over woodsmoke in most places and this was worth the side trip!  Sides were veggies and sweet potatoes. The wines on offer were so reasonably priced- most under $20 a bottle but a decent selection. They just don't mark them up 5x like most places! 

Our waitress Lisa also made great recommendations and her service was welcoming, friendly, and excellent. We are so glad we went local instead of to a chain. Bookmarking this place for a return trip next time I am in Tampa for sure!
--------------------
Yelp doesn't allow to leave 0 star review, so that is why you see one star. Me and my wife are moving from NY to South California, and we contacted 5 different moving companies. I sent my initial email to United Van Lines on 05/02/2018, and soon I got email back with Virtual Survey confirmation for 05/10. The lady that did virtual survey was very meticulous and professional and we "screened" through the whole apartment in 15 minutes. No one contacted me after that, so I sent a second email almost a month after, on 06/05 asking if everything is ok, and if I can get the quote. I don't need to mention that other 4 companies sent their quotes in less than 48 hours. Since no one replied til today, I called the direct phone and I left the message on the answering machine. No one called me back. I hope everything is ok, and that no one is hurt, because I don't see any other reasonable explanation why they are avoiding me. Very, very unprofessional.
--------------------
Returned to get a fill and pedicure a week after getting a gel polish change, once I discovered the cost would be over $85 I canceled the pedicure and only wanted a fill. Originally the owner was very nice and attentive but when she sensed I refused to pay their ridiculous price, she turned her attention completely off of me and showed absolutely no regard. She no longer cared for my business and she had no problem showing it. She even reassigned the nail tech to someone else bc I refused to be over charged for service. I asked why the original nail tech was no longer doing my fill, I got no answer. I looked over and saw the owner catering to customers that had just walked in. I sensed flaky business so I ultimately walked out without being serviced. Horrible customer service from the owner. I understand they use quality products but not everyone is looking to spend hundreds of dollars in a nail salon regardless of how "high end" it's self proclaimed to be!
--------------------
Late one Saturday night, some friends and I made the mistake of trying to get drinks at Plough and the Stars and left very quickly. We were walking around trying to find somewhere else to go, noticed this unmarked bar and decided to check it out. We were so excited to see that there were so many great beers on tap, and there was a decent crowd there so we stuck around. It was a fun night! And after a few weeks of wondering where we had gone, we were able to find the Irish Pol on Yelp :D

I went back for happy hour recently and it wasn't exactly as I had remembered. It was pretty dark and dingy looking inside,  and the few people there were much much older. It just had a weird vibe. The beer was still great of course. The happy hour special was $3 drafts, but most of the beers I wanted weren't included. I won't be back for happy hour, but I would definitely stop in on a Saturday night!
--------------------
We visited this place because of its location on the wharf, and because my husband loves seafood. It's tiny, but we were there on a Tuesday evening, and only had to wait a few minutes. We ended up sitting at the bar; it would have been a longer wait for a table outside, since there are so few. Because of its size, it's a little noisy, but not bad. The service was very good. My husband had the crab sandwich, and wasn't impressed. It's served on very uninspiring white bread. I had the fried shrimp, and enjoyed it very much; it was not greasy or heavy, and the shrimp was moist and tasty. There is literally nothing but shellfish on the menu. So, the non-seafood enthusiast (me) was happily surprised to enjoy the shrimp so much (plus good onion rings), but the seafood enthusiast (my husband) didn't love the crab sandwich. If we tried this place again, he would order something else. The location is awesome, so if you like shellfish, definitely give this place a try.
--------------------
I met a buddy mine at this spot that I have always wanted to go to, but have never had the time. I walked in and sat at the bar. The police were investigating a burglary from the overnight it seemed some dirt bags broke in on a side door and stole a bunch of liquor from the bar. The bartender was great and service was prompt. I ordered a pint  of dark ale and my buddy and I split a order of wings. The beer was cold and the wings were very tasty. I remembered meeting the owners of the establishment at the last Italian Fest at the Farmers Market so I really wanted to like this place as they were very friendly folks. I will continue to patronize this spot as it was a great spot close to home and work. I also like the locally non franchised making it work attitude that this place gives. I really was very comfortable at this establishment and well tell the rest of fellow Yelpers to hit this spot!!!
--------------------
Harry's blue bell is a nice spot. We stopped a few days ago for a quick dinner. It's tucked in the corner of a shopping center and it's very easy to miss. It was packed and seemed like the place to be for locals. The inside is nice but small, only a few tables in the entire place. The service was just okay. 

The beer selection is very good as are the prices on the beer. The food menu was a bit limited with you're basic bar food. The wife went with the bbq pulled pork and I went with the chicken and honey mustard wrap. The bbq pork was good, the bun was nicely toasted but the sauce was overly sweet for our liking. The wrap was fresh and good but nothing spectacular. The fries were hot and crispy. The kale slaw was fantastic but a very small portion.

Overall it was a decent meal. I wouldn't go out of my way to go back. If I were in the area I'd stop though. Solid 3 stars.
--------------------
I love it!  The reviews were great and I was desperate for good carry out, so we decided to try Pizzaville (is anyone else picturing JT singing - Bring it on down to Pizzaville?).  The prices are a bit high, but the quality of the food is great!  The pizza crust is between a hand tossed and thin crust.  Perfectly crunchy ends and just chewy enough in the middle.  Good quality cheese and tangy tomato sauce. I ordered it with just mushrooms and they put on a lot!   I also asked for heavy sauce.  They put extra sauce on the pizza and even gave me an extra container of sauce in case I needed more. 

I can't decide which was better, the pizza or "breadsticks."  I say "breadsticks" because they were really more like garlic bread strips.  So buttery and garlicy, they were great even without sauce.  I'm ashamed to say I ate nearly the entire order myself.  

The employees are very nice and helpful.  The store is clean. I need to go back and try their lunch buffet.
--------------------
On a scale of one to things that are awesome, this place is the bomb. 

I was drawn in by the promise of the duckfat frenchfries. Took the boy for his birthday and put our name in, had a drink around the corner while we waited and were given seats at the bar after about 45 minutes. 

We were waited on by Keith, the bartender, who was congenial, knowledgeable about his whiskeys and an all-around cool guy. We started with 3 cape may salts (two for me, one for the boy) and tater tots, both of which made me happy.

For dinner, I got Kentucky Fried Quail (stellar, though the succotash was not as exciting as I wanted it to be) and the boy got the 24$ Fois Gras burger, which was incredible. Worth every penny. The duckfat fries were pretty yummy, but not even the best part of the meal. I could've done without the cheese sauce, but as it was on the side I wasn't deterred.

I look forward to coming back here, with everyone I know.
--------------------
So we've been wanting to try the sushiritos since they opened up a location closer to us and we finally tried it last Friday. 

I got the slammin' salmon and my wife got the crunch. I'd say they both definitely had fresh ingredients, and definitely tasted fresh, but I think the balance of flavors wasn't quite right for the slammin' salmon. Way too heavy on the sauce, completely overpowering the crisp fresh veggies and salmon. 

We tried the Japanese fried chicken. Sauce is a little sweet and sour. And the chicken was a little dry. 

We also tried their green tea and lemonade, which were pretty good, but you don't come to a place like this because their green tea and lemonade are their best things on the menu. 

Overall, you pay a high premium for a gimmicky meal. With this location being essentially at a revolving door of new customers on the corner of Penn's campus, I think they have the potential to do well. But I don't think I'll be coming back. We'll take our $34 elsewhere.
--------------------
This place is good~  The chicken is moist, the skin is crispy, the flavor is nice and smokey, this is the best kind of roast chicken I have tried. The smells (smokey, bbq) is so good and hypnotizing, just make my mouth water.  I got the double chicken family which is 2 whole chickens, literally a bed of fries underneath them, and cole slaw.  It was more than enough to feed a family of four.  The dipping sauces that come with it are also real good, i really like the mustard base one, its kinda mustardy with a chipotle flair, and there is also a green sauce that is like a salsa.  The fries are wedge fries and they make you real full because there are plenty to go around. We had leftovers because the meal was that big.  I would rather eat here than popeyes or kfc, because you get more, its healthier, and you get better service. The owners are real nice and friendly. I will be back because I know I will be craving this chicken.
--------------------
I took an 8 year old and a 14 year old for the lunch special pizza.  We have done this on several occasions, and the kids love that they each get their own personal pizza, made the way they like.   They both ordered their pizza with 2 items and wanted BBQ sauce as the base instead of tomato sauce.  (this is the only way they enjoy pizza).   I was told that they could only get tomato sauce, not BBQ sauce.   I explained that we have gotten it this way several times before.   We were told that they don't offer it this way any more.   I see that some of the pizzas offer BBQ sauce and pointed it out, but again was told that it couldn't be made this way for them.   I asked if I could pay additional to have it made with BBQ sauce, but once again told it was not possible.   Sadly, we left the restaurant and chose a different nearby restaurant for lunch.  I'm sorry to say I won't be able to take the kids here anymore.
--------------------
After having been here, I would say that the food had great flavors for the taste buds and it was a unique experience.  Our server, Brian was no doubt a foodie... I've never seen anyone get so excited about food and discuss the ingredients in such detail with so much passion.  The food really was different and had unbelievable flavor.  Anyone who calls themselves a foodie should try this place.  I'm thinking they would be pleased with this place.  But, the portions were small.  And I really didn't like the interior of the restaurant.  I'm more of a booths girl.  Booths can be classy, you know?  All in all, I would say this was an interesting place and I would come back, but the dishes were too complicated for me to want to come back beyond once a year.  Speaking of timing, the chefs change the menu every year.  And these guys really are good at what they do.  The owners actually own the Red Pony and two other restaurants all on the same street!  And they're all doing well.
--------------------
Great community vibe... i've run into friends and struck up conversation with new ones each time i've been in.  Its nice to have new hang within walking distance of my house.  I've stuck to the classic burger and love it... everything from the buns to the ketchup is made in-house and has unique taste. The bar had pretty much whatever i wanted... last night the bartenders made some homespun watermelon concoction.

To touch on some other reviews... i understand everyone has a different experience, but to say the place is 'too hipster' seems like someones still jaded from feeling left out in high school...  and personally attacking the owner is tasteless and has no place in a review.  We should be glad we don't all have someone looking over our shoulder attacking our motives. I like what Burger Up is trying to do and i like that they hired a bunch of folks representative of our Nashville community... if you need a non-musician wait staff who dresses just like you and takes you to prom, you're probably in the wrong town.
--------------------
Maybe I just had bad luck at this property but I am a SPG gold member... quickly approaching platinum and made a reservation at this property. I payed a good amount for my room and when I asked for a larger room they told me they where all the same. I asked did every room have adjoining doors and was told yes. I then told the front desk clerk that I could hear EVERYTHING going on next door including sneezing and even AC talking on CNN 360 very clearly. He told me to come down and get a new key and move to a room there was nobody in. They did not offer to bring me a key or help me move. When I got to the lobby the line was at least 10 people deep and there was only ONE person there. I just gave up and dealt with the noise and a few hours later they finally turned off the TV and I could sleep.  There is nothing fancy about this hotel and the service for sure needs improvement!
--------------------
I must say I'm very disappointed, my two stars are for presentation and prompt delivery. I ordered the rainbow roll, white tuna roll, calamari and chicken lettuce wraps. Where do I begin? ok with the bad. 

I strongly feel that when you are delivering food that should be served cold, you don't put it in a bag with hot food because that equals mushy, warm sushi, which is what I got. The rainbow roll, which normally is topped with raw fish was topped with mushy avocado????? which I ended up peeling off to salvage the sushi. The spicy white tuna roll was very good.

The calamari looked like chicken fingers all the breading was falling off and it was under cooked, I took one bite and tossed it. Now I've had lettuce wraps before but mines came with an actual head of lettuce in a bag and chicken filling in a plate. It was not described this way in the menu at all. All in all I don't think I'll be ordering from here again. I'll stick to Niji's on 5th.
--------------------
Like many other reviewers I passed by this place a number of times before looking it up on Yelp and realizing that I really did need to give it a shot...
Wow... I was not disappointed!
We started out with the crab cake appetizer- it was very well portioned (2 large crab cakes) and the sauce with it had an interesting hint of dill (just lovely and refreshing and a little different).
We were feeling like comfort food and had the chicken tenders-  The portions were very generous and the food was just solid.  Not fussy or stuffy or trying hard... just good, wholesome and good to eat.
The service was fine- however there is only one waitress for the tables and the bar, so i can imagine that if it is full that would cause some delays.  Overall it was just a lovely meal and the prices were unbelievably reasonable (most places have crabcakes 1/2 that size for twice that price)...
The ambiance is nice, nothing crazy but it is just a very nice option with reasonable prices and lovely food!
--------------------
Milktooth is the place to go if you want a good breakfast cocktail and a twist on traditional brunch. At first glance of the menu, you may think you've never heard of any of these foods for breakfast, and you may be right. I guarantee no matter what you order, you're going to enjoy it. 

Milktooth is one of the most popular brunch places in Indy, which means you will typically have a wait. Trust me, it's worth the usual 30 minute wait (on weekends). To make it go by a little faster, they've got a walk up bar for their coffee drinks and pastries. Snack on one of those to give you a preview of the amazing meal you're about to have.

Their menu changes from time to time but they have a few things that stay one the menu but change ingredients. I love all of their variations on a Dutch pancake, and their raclette grilled cheese is to die for.  If you're making this a boozy breakfast, don't pass up on the michelada. And sit outside if it's warm enough!
--------------------
I find it hugely ironic that WF is trying to reposition itself as a 'value' food store right now when others (i.e. Trader Joe's up the street) have been doing that for years.  For value, go elsewhere.  For pretty food, lovely store displays and a feeling of smugness, check out Whole Foods.

Despite my snark, I have to admit that it's nice to see an enormous, clean and well stocked yuppie market in Reno finally.  Now that this town has been rated by National Geographic as a top outdoors place to live in, it needs the retail to support that (and I don't mean another REI).  For myself, I'm too cheap to look seriously at this place for my regular shopping needs, but for lunch and the odd stopover, it's awesome.   Beautiful produce, drool inducing cheese selections and a bakery that would break my budget if I bought everything that struck my fancy.

Plus it's proximity to the freeway (for those of us who do our shopping based on distance from the 395 or 80) makes it an ideal stop to/from the airport.
--------------------
Second stop for Center City Restaurant Week:  R2L, dinner for $35 each. 

On the 37th floor of Two Liberty Place is a very fancy-cool restaurant/lounge where you can get a bird's eye view of the city! Group of us went to dinner here together after a day of meetings. Didn't get one of the tables facing the windows, but still had great views of the sunset and city by night. Again, multiple choices for the three courses, but I chose to start with the crisp peas/ham/garlic risotto [balls]. Main course was the Butcher's Filet (braised short rib + Steuben bean chili, potato/farm veg slaw and basil), which was quite heavy since there was also meat in the chili as well. The dazzling dessert to finish it off was the milk chocolate + hazelnut pudding served with salted caramel and coffee to melt the chocolate, and candied almonds on the side. A bottle of wine for the table as well. Food was great, waiter was awesome (making sure to warn me that the risotto came in ball form rather than a bowl, for instance), very classy experience.
--------------------
I made my Yelp account for the soul purpose of reviewing this place; I think that very much speaks to how I enjoyed the experience. It's exactly what you would expect from a local cafe/coffee shop and then some. The food and coffee were great and the atmosphere was very friendly and casual. The architecture of the dining room was very cool as well - it had a very Victorian feel, which I personally love. The service was a bit slow, but the barista was the only person working behind the counter and she was also very personable, so for that we can forgive her. When I go to a coffee shop I usually go to stay and relax, often reading or sketching. It is the perfect place for that, with both indoor and outdoor tables, a booth, and a counter. I also appreciated the dog-friendly policy but that's definitely a personal preference and isn't right for everyone. The location is also great, being situated in the French quarter. My only complaint is that I could only visit once on my trip to New Orleans.
--------------------
Yeah, I know what you're thinking. One Wawa store is pretty much the same as another, so why even bother writing a review? But I think we have a winner here.

When this Wawa store opened for business, gas prices at gas stations all along Concord Pike fell by 30 cents per gallon just to compete with them. Sure, this Wawa store could've followed the general pricing in the area and lowered prices just a few cents, keeping the bulk of the profit. But no, they'll have none of that. I love a store that is on the side of my wallet!

Secondly, I love the automatic start/stop digital air pump. So far, I've only seen that at BJ's Wholesale and Sheetz. It's a snap to use and I get the exact tire pressure every time.

As for service, they seem nice and relatively efficient. The internal layout of the store is the new style that I first saw in Newark. Having separate non-cigarette cashier lines may speed things up in peak periods, although I've never been there during the day, so I wouldn't know.
--------------------
After coming here for many years, I was very disappointed by my last trip. The one place you never cut corners is in the food, and that's exactly what they did. 2 of the 3 salsas were so watery that you didn't get any tomatillo or tomato on your chip, at all. The third salsa, the pics de gallo, was the worst chop job I've ever seen in a restaurant. Huge pieces of Serrano pepper with varying sizes of everything else, and in stark contrast to the other 2, completely dried out. 

Without even looking at the menu, I know what I want... #15. That decision hasn't changed for over 10 years. Today I should have made a different choice. I'm not sure if they recently went thru a purveyor change but the quality of everything on the plate was horrible. 

I used to love the rice, it changed. I used to love the chicken quesadilla, now it's flavorless and covered in 2 lbs of cheese for 1/2 a breast.

Please go back to your old ways and cut costs elsewhere, other than the food.
--------------------
I've been wanting to try Trust Me BBQ for over a year now.  I stopped in there about 3 months ago and waited in line for 10 minutes with no service and left.  After reading reviews, I figured I'd give it a chance again just to see what all the fuss is about.  The food was 50/50 but the service was horrible so I'll likely never return.  The gentleman behind the counter didn't speak, smile or engage with us at all, I felt like I was at a vending machine.  Once we finally ordered, he didn't even listen to the order and put the wrong sides in our meals, we had to correct him while he was serving.  All in all, I will just stick with Down to the Bone BBQ

Pros:  BBQ Sauce is delicious, macaroni salad was different and interesting, "pulled" pork was moist.

Cons:  Chicken was more dry than a sheet of paper, inedible even with the BBQ Sauce.  Mac & Cheese was served from a pan that has probably been on the steam table for 2-3 days.  Collard Greens were very mildly flavored.
--------------------
Cru is such a cute quaint wine bar! In the front is a wine store and in the back ins the wine bar. The wine bar area is small but had a very modern atmosphere.

I started off with the Vina Vino wine flight and my friends ordered The Bold and the Beautiful. Both came on a cute wood/chalkboard board with the wine written in chalk. All the wines were very tasty but the Vespucci  Primitivo and the Il Fauno di Arcanum were my favorite.

We then ordered the fig jam and prosciutto, bleu cheese, arugula flatbread. A little heavy on the blue cheese for my liking but overall was really good. We also ordered the Farmers Platter. You can choose anything from 1-7 items and build your plate from a variety of cheese and meats. We selected the Brillat-Savarin, Cypress Grove "Purple Haze", Blue Brie, Spressata and the Italian Speck. The farmers plate also came with jam, mustard,  caramelized nuts and crostini. The Farmers plate by far was my favorite!

Overall I really liked CRU. Its cute, quaint and cozy. Can't wait to come back!!
--------------------
We have big group of 12 for the office outing lunch. I would said for the number of people we have, the service is not the best but good enough. Only one of our members get the food late. The close out may need to work on it. Tip was added since we have large group which may my bill easy. 

I have order the lamb kebab (Shish Kebab) plate. It come with two choices of side. I got the rice and the babaghanoush. The rice was well cook and nice aroma. The babaghanoush was well prepared and great with extra olive oil. The presentation of the dish is pleasant. However, the meat did not measured up. It was too dry and the marinated is not over the top. They need to improve on this area. 

I have been here several time. My previous experience is better. During the month of Ramadan, they serve the buffet that are plenty of choices and attractive. I would said try them during this time. The buffet of Ramadan usually start at 8:30. Go early because is a lot of customers.
--------------------
Came here with a group of 15 people on a Tuesday night. We had reserved a space in advance. 
While the food was good, what was lacking was good service and cleanliness. We sat down at our table and it was sticky, and there was a dirty and also sticky fork still on it...so the assumption was that the table simply hadn't been wiped down all the way. Yuck. 
We ordered and the food took a fair amount of time, understandable because of such a large party. Problem was, when the food came out, no server knew what we'd individually ordered, so it became a huge mix up with people eating others' food. 
I ordered the pork belly tacos which had a great caramelization on the outside and tender inside. I also ordered the spicy beef pho, which was perfectly balanced with flavor after adding the accompanying bean sprouts and limes. 
The wait for the check and processing payment was long and arduous, a problem again because we had a Lyft driver waiting outside for us. 
All in all, go for the food, not for the service.
--------------------
by 3 stars, i really mean 3.5-

white brick walls, cool rustic furniture, seasoned, attractive employees. and the lighting is lovely.. nay, PERFECT. probably good for a blind date.  and service is good and timely.

but 3.5 could've been 4 if it wasn't so expensive for what i'm getting. and if the kitchen was more accommodating.

the first time i ever ate there, (around when it first opened), i ordered ravioli and received 3 or 5 pieces for $11-13.  another time i visited, i tried substituting a salad for fries with my burger. and my server said, "no, sorry, the kitchen won't do that." 

are you $^%ER@# kidding me??? it wasn't a super modification. it's not as if i asked for a burger with only one bun, no tomato, half piece of lettuce, two onion rings, and love. it wasn't like i wanted to substitute lobster for fries!!! needless to say, this is the first time i've been unable to substitute. i'm usually really easy to please, but this is the first time i've ever felt difficult. at least in my head. is this in my head?

unforgivable.
--------------------
If you want to pay for everything a la carte this is the place for you.  
Food wasn't terrible not impressive.
They brought a basket of chips and some tomato sauce which I asked politely for something spicier and some pico de gallo.  She brought them happily to me and the salsa was much better.  When asked what we would like to drink I asked for a coke and she brought out a bottle which I stated I wanted the fountain drink.  She said "oh that's only Pepsi".  Never mentioned that they only had bottle drinks for coke.  
We ordered our food which was reasonably priced, asked for sour cream and also to put cheese on the taco.  She let us know cheese was extra.  
It was $2.50 extra for another basket of chips.  
When I received the bill we paid more for the condiments then the actual food.  Side of sour cream 2.00, pico de gallo 2.50, salsa 2.00, chips 2.50, cheese 1.00 and the bottled coke that we didn't want 5.00.  
Just a suggestion...when you order anything make sure to ask if there is an extra charge.
--------------------
You would think from the size of the place it would be good for groups, but in my experience with 9 people on Saturday at 11am it was about a very hungry, tiring wait to get a seat. 

We tried to make reservations, but they do not take them. And I think we were too small to be put in the side meeting room. So hangry we stood, hoping for just the right table to leave.

The manager was nice enough to offer to fill cups of coffee for us while we waited. But I thought it was odd that they just didn't refill the pot for everyone who was waiting. 

Now for the food...They have these 1/2 and 1/2 combos. Which I love! I got a turkey Reuben and salad. I asked for lots of sauerkraut, and they charged $0.50 for it.. Which is no biggie but I'd expect a lot of kraut. Sadly there was not a lot of it.. But it was still a delicious sandwhich.  :) My friend got the sunrise chile rellenos. If I come back with a smaller party, that is what I would get.
--------------------
I decided to stop by since I was in the area and craving some authentic Mexican cuisine. I was literally by myself (late lunchtime on a tues) and really excited to try the pazole!! It was delicious ( granted my first and only time) I believe it's pork and has hominy, lettuce, radishes,onions and they give you a small container of dried oregano. Not the biggest fan of the lettuce cause it's gets all wilted but add some hot sauce and it's a meal in itself!!! I got also got the taco lunch special (2 pork tacos and rice) and that was good. Besides the amazing service from the sweet lady, the salsa was way sweet! Wasn't the biggest fan but everything is def fresh! And the pineapple water is a must. I don't like pineapples but I read reviews and just had to try it and thank u guys! Great reviews :) I'm excited to come back to try the burritos esp since I come out here for Costco shopping (soooo close by!) pretty dangerous when I find good food cause then I get cravings :/ enjoy this gem and eat up!!!
--------------------
I dropped my car off first thing in the morning for a simple "check engine" light appointment. I was told at the end of that day that my car had not been looked at and would not be ready until the following day. What was the point of making an appointment, if they didn't even touch my car? The next evening when I came to pick it up, after they called me to tell me it was ready, I waited for a full hour before my car was given to me. They had parked so many cars in front of it they couldn't get it out. That is an hour of my life I will never get back, all because someone called and told me to come pick up my car (...which was there for two full business days, unnecessarily. For the record, there was nothing wrong with the car. It needed no repair and no maintenance). There was a kind woman who asked how they could make it up to me, but I had to tell her that I will likely never return, so it wasn't worth her time.
--------------------
Beer service was lackluster. The first beer I ordered had an off flavor (sour). I ordered a taste of another similar dark beer to see if the problem was endemic but it wasn't. I would have appreciated it more if the bar tender looked into the off flavor when I sent my beer back. This tells me the bar tender doesn't know beer. I assume that particular draft line needs to be cleaned but maybe the problem was with the keg. 

Another thing that killed me was their use of glassware. They serve beers in the classic American "Shaker" pint glass and serve water in the far superior English Nonic Pint glass. I also saw the bar tender pour a white ale with normal ABV in a stemmed tulip glass.

The shaker pint glasses are kept refrigerated and are too cold in my opinion. I would much rather see them kept at room temp and rinsed in cold water (which they do here). 

All in all, the beer knowledge is not up to par for a place that advertises as a burger joint with a large craft beer selection (30 taps).
--------------------
This was my very 1st time in New Orleans. It's been an amazing experience and so far, every single place I've eaten at has been AMAZING. So... I took a chance with The Praline Connection and walked in. Why? The ambiance and the restaurant, overall, looked nice. 
However... I would NEVER return to this place again, nor would I Ever RECOMMEND it to Anyone. 

APPETIZERS:
I ordered the BBQ Oysters and..wow.. fucking wow...1st of all the oysters not in their shells. Instead they placed in a soup cup filled with  "BBQ sauce" that tasted like cheap Ketchup and Chef Boyarde! Disgusting! The oysters themselves were gooey.

The garlic bread was God awful! It tasted like stale frozen garlic bread. To make matters worse, when I received these appetizers, they were cold.. It tasted and looked like they had been microwaved and left out.  

I also ordered the Chicken wings. They were under cooked, cold and the sauce was nasty.  

The other members of our party ordered entrees. They all said, "This Sucks!"

PROS: The service was great. The servers were all very polite and attentive. 
Restaurant was clean, nice tables, nice ambiance.
--------------------
I have been a patron of Desi Village in West Philly for years.  After moving the suburbs, we saw the KOP Desi Village and finally tried it.  We were skeptical having also tried Mood Cafe (owned by the W.Philly folks), and it wasn't as good. But the KOP location is actually very comparable to the West Philly location.  

There is no ambiance or atmosphere here.  The strip mall where it's located is pretty depressing.  Desi Village may be the only active store in it.  And its decor is tired and old.  It is a big space and it appears they do a big lunch buffet but I'm curious if it's ever full.  So don't go for the ambiance.

But the food is good.  We ordered some Keema Naan, Samosas, Saag Paneer, and Lamb Biryani.  All of it was really good.  Perfectly seasoned, not too oily, and appropriately spicy.  I have a nut allergy and made them aware of that and they did not screw it up (most Indian restaurants do).  So we'll definitely be back.  It would be great if they moved into nicer digs but the food is what is most important.
--------------------
I am positively LIVID.

I went to check my account balance and what do I see? An overdraft fee of $220.
How could this happen? My card was never declined and there are two large fees deducted from my account.

I called TD and sat on hold for 45 MINUTES. I don't have that kind of time. Granted, the guy that was with me was nice and helpful, but never mentioned anything about the wait time until I brought it up. I asked about these fees and he said "Just so you are aware, TD Bank's new policy is that when you have insufficient funds, your card will not be declined. It will be run through, and you will be charged an overdraft fee."
OH THANK YOU FOR TELLING ME NOW, JERK.

I have too many salty words that are unacceptable in the public domain, so I'll stop now.

Needless to say, I am switching banks.

Sort of UPDATE:
I thought you Yelpers would like to know that last night, when I was depositing the cash that I didn't have into my account via ATM, I flipped off the cameras.
TAKE THAT, TD.
--------------------
We went here hoping for a good breakfast,  and we weren't disappointed.  We went on Valentine's Day, not because we wanted to, but because we had to.  In doing so,  we knew the wait would be long, which it was (an hour and a half), though i hear there's always a wait. 

The place is buzzing with servers and busboys. The tables around the edges of the room are a bit close to one another,  so seating is tight.  The service was though, considering how busy it was.  I ordered the famed cornmeal pancakes with a side of hash browns and a fried egg.  My girlfriend ordered the banana pancakes with a side of bacon.  Everything was amazing.  The pancakes were hearty but fluffy... The side of bacon only comes with three pieces which is disappointing,  but it was cooked to her liking.  The cornmeal pancakes had just the right amount of everything... Bacon,  peppers... Salsa, sour cream,  syrup... Yes,  all of that.  If you're looking for good coffee,  this is not the place, which was surprising. 

The only question is do you go with the homemade syrup or the maple.... Or both
--------------------
This wasn't my first visit to the Italian Centre, but my last visit was many years ago and all I could remember was the huge selection of charcuterie and cheeses. Slightly overwhelming to say the least, meats and cheeses (at the time) I had never even heard of. With some guidance from the staff I was able to select some delights. 

Fast forward a few years... 

My most recent visit was only for some pastries and a quick lunch, so I didn't have time to browse the huge selection of Italian delights. 

I decided to go with the Mossimo pizza. The toppings were fresh the cheese was bubbly! The crust was thin and baked to perfection. I wasn't expecting such a huge pizza- definitely big enough to share! And priced at just $14? A steal if you ask me!

For pastries we chose the Cream Horns; while they were quite pricy, they were certainly delicious. Likely made that day, they were fresh, creamy and flakey! Impossible not to over indulge! 

While visiting the Italian Centre I suggest enjoying a freshly crafted coffee beverage and a pastry. The perfect treat before or after shopping.
--------------------
Back to Tom Jones and time to update my review. I didn't see that odd ATM type machine that only lets you withdraw money to apply to your check. It's no longer there-used to be next to restrooms. There is still a payphone back there which I love. There are now ATM's at front entrance.
  The blue ribbon is now $3.79, but still a bargain since it includes everything: pancakes, 2 eggs, toast, sausage, bacon,juice & coffee. I ate here with my kids. My daughter's choice. Says she "loves Tom Jones". Our meals included blue ribbons, french toast, chicken, club sandwich & baked potato . Everyone gets what they like. 
   I don't smell stale smoke and would not call it dirty.  I like the "loud" orange booths. I feel like I went back in time with these and the payphone. Service is always fast and I always seem to get a different waitress. Don't know where they find these young ladies but they're good. I've seen different managers there and they are all quick and on top of things-which makes a good manager.
   Since it's my daughter's fave I'm bumping it up from 4 to 5 stars.
--------------------
I can't recall the day I went but it was a memorial resturant experience.  I was greeted by an incredibly nice cashier. After a hard decision I ordered a Devils delight and the girl giggled ( of course I was confused) She explained it was Dev's Delight and named after her because it was her idea for a burger and me calling it Devils delight was a bit funny because her friends call her Devil Dev ( hard to believe such a nice girl could aquire such a nickname but cute). After she took my thorough of a medium burger, and truffle fires i didn't have to wait very long. Even before I ate the burger the smell it self had my mouth watering.  The burger was cooked to perfection and what was on the burger was amazing!  This burger was a standard beef foundation with mozzarella cheese tomato basil and a portobello mushroom, what great idea for a burger! For a mushroom lover this with a side of the delicious truffle fries is perfect. Excellent quality and service,  a bit expensive but worth every penny. No question about it I will be a return customer!
--------------------
Went here with a few friends as the place to have our reunion dinner. We hadn't seen eachother since elementary school and got reacquainted through Facebook so this was a pretty special dinner. 

The restaurant is very swanky and the prices show this. I do think the food was worth the price although all of my party thought it was very expensive. I ordered the lobster bake which was delicious. It was not fantastic and there wasn't alot of seafood but it was adequate for me. I also ordered a Neopolitan Old Fashion which was made perfectly. 

My friends ordered the fritters, carpaccio, crab cake and fries. Plus 2 shots of tequila, a lemonade and 2 more old fashions. Bill was $170 which is not bad but some of my friends weren't expected it. 

And I must say something about our waiter. Unfortunately, I didn't remember his name but he was fantastic! Very attentive, nice and even bought out a dessert because it was also one of my friend's bday. He was just real cool. 

5 stars for service
3 stars for food
4 stars for ambience 
2 stars for price.  

But I was satisfied.
--------------------
After numerous visits here, we really wanted to like this place but each time there has been a number of issues, many repeating. No matter the time of day, it seems to get pretty rowdy and my friends and I have had drinks spilled on us on multiple occasions. Almost every time I have been here with my fiancé or friends, it has taken an abnormally long time to get service whether it be inside, outside at a table or bar. The food is mediocre for the price and a few times the food took MUCH longer to come out than what we were told, and when asking management what was going on, we were told that the estimate was wrong and it was "too bad". Staff is rude and far from attentive, though it seems like this place is always over-staffed when we have been here. Amazes me that management allows such a huge lack in customer service. No longer wasting our time and money here, and we advise our friends and family to do the same. It is too much of a hit-and-miss to come here and attempt to have a good time.
--------------------
IF YOU ARE ON A STUDENT BUDGET, READ ON:

This is a 5 mile wide/long convention center. It has up to 2,000 guestrooms.  The conference I went to had 6,000 attendants. Of course I booked late and I didn't want to spend $200+/night on these hotel rooms! Otherwise this place is ginormous. The service (shuttle), lunch/drinks were really well done.  This place is immaculate; I do not know how many workers they staff.  

The food of course is overpriced (I had lunch/dinner at Wasabi. My bento box was $25.  Overpriced right?)  I also had lunch at the pizza place Paisano (forgot the name).   

If you decide to stay at the hotels across the street from the convention center (it is only 1 mile away - across from the McGovick Pwky).  They have Cracker Barrel, Apple Bees, Chillis?, McDonalds there.  The hotel I stayed in (being on a student budget) was crappy but I can't complain for $55/night.  It was Days Inn. It was walkable to shuttle pick up stop at Marriott Hotel (walk ~0.3 miles).  

They have Finleys pub, FUSE (night/club), STAX burger, Jack Daniels and more restaurants inside this convention center.  

I posted some photos.
--------------------
If you're looking for a great brunch place in New Orleans, definitely come here!

My boyfriend and I had brunch here on Sunday, and we loved it! We both started with the Brandy Milk Punch, which was divine.  If you are of age, order this drink!  It is an alcoholic milkshake, and I could literally go here just to drink that because it is so good.  

They bring out fresh bread and butter, and then my boyfriend and I ordered the trio of appetizers.  The trio is quite small, but it includes a duck springroll, fried chicken livers and a fried oyster.  The duck springroll came with a wonderful tangy sauce, which I greatly enjoyed.  My boyfriend enjoyed the fried chicken livers and the fried oyster, but those are not two of my favorite things.

For my entree, I ordered the shrimp and grits.  Oh my goodness... so good! The shrimp are bacon-wrapped, and the grits are true Southern grits.  I will definitely order this dish again when I get the chance to return.  My boyfriend ordered the fish of the day, which was blackened Mahi Mahi, and he loved it.  

Definitely go to Mr. B's!
--------------------
Yes, there are vegan options in University City, you just have to know where to look for them. MexiCali has a number of great options.

Many options here can be made vegan by holding the cheese. I absolutely adore the marinated tofu burrito. The tofu has a wonderfully chewy texture, and along with the black beans, the meal packs a protein-filled punch that will leave you full well past dinner-time, should you choose to finish it.  The sweet potato and plantain burrito is purportedly dairy-free, and it's another delicious, filling vegan option. The veggie tacos come with a spicier version of the sweet potato, the marinated tofu and some cabbage on doubled corn tortillas. The tacos are not as filling as the burritos, but they're a delicious lighter option. Finally, a fourth option for vegans: the guacamole burrito. They homemade guac is to-die-for delicious. 

I end up at MexiCali about once a week. I've been going since they were just a lunch truck 8 years back. There's often a line at the restaurant, but this place has been around for years and they have a great system to get you your burrito in a very timely manner.
--------------------
I visited Joe's on consecutive nights, one with a Living Social coupon.  The beef tacos on the appetizer menu were outstanding, and a great price which will ensure I order them every time I come.  Meatloaf and mashed potatoes were just as I expected; thankfully, no attempt to "fancy them up"; just tasty comfort food.  I asked for French dressing and bleu cheese crumbles on my salad, and they were generous with the cheese.  The salad was cold and fresh and crisp.

The reason I did not give five stars was the service. The first night, we weren't told of specials (ugh, saw them on the way out and would have ordered them!), and my friend's appetizer order was wrong. Drinks were not refilled often enough, and the waitress seemed uninformed about some of the items.  The next night, different waitress. We were one of only two tables, and still waited too long for her to return. She was unable to answer a question about a menu item, as well.

The place is beautiful, and the bathroom was clean and bright.  The menu offers many thoughtfully composed choices. Some of your servers are not up to par.
--------------------
While at Drexel University, I decided to try a new food truck and go for something that wasn't the typical food truck.  My girlfriend and I always noticed this place was crowded around lunch but never knew why.  After being recommended to try it by a friend, we decided to go ahead and order lunch here.  Cucina Zapata is at the end of the food truck row at the center of Drexel University's campus.  The truck has a graffiti style design which can be easily distinguished from the other food trucks here.

I decided to order (2) thai short rib tacos while my girlfriend got the cap'n crunch tilapia burrito.  The food has a good visual appearance which made us more eager to eat it once we got inside the building.  I really enjoyed the thai short rib tacos even though they put hot sauce on it.  They were definitely better than the typical taco bell food and left me with a 5 star review feeling inside.  My girlfriend also really enjoyed her burrito.

Overall, this food truck provides very good food at a good price.  I recommend this place to anyone looking for a good lunch.
--------------------
Wow!!  That really sums up, in a very good way, my interactions with Delicious Designs and Leigh Anne!  Our wedding was only planned two months out and was supposed to be very very small so no cake was needed.  As the weeks went by, the guest list increased, so I decided I wanted a cake.  With probably less than a weeks notice, Leigh Anne stepped up and made the exact cake I had in my head.  I asked for a simple two tier lemon cake with no decorations.  Not only did she make this happen beautifully, she made chocolate vegan cupcakes for my daughter at the last minute.    I'm attaching a picture of the cake "table".  My daughter did the decorating and I must say, for someone with not much in the decorating department, everything came out better than I could ever imagine.  And not only was the cake perfect, it was yummy delicious.  I can't wait for my one year anniversary to dig in to that top layer! 

If you are in need of any bakery needs in Reno and you don't use Leigh Anne with Delicious Designs, well then all I can say is I'm sorry!
--------------------
Let me start by saying buying a car is an intimidating process. I feel like I am playing poker with someone who can see all of the cards while I can only see my cards. I felt well prepared and needed to use all of my preparation to get what I considered to be a fair deal (time will tell whether I really got a fair deal) on a used (pre-owned is what they like to say) car. Do your homework (KBB.com, Edmunds.com etc) As long as the car performs like I expect it to over time, I will be happy. Sam Ladd was the salesman who always treated me courteously and let me drive lots of cars while I was deciding what vehicle I wanted. I drove everything from subcompacts to full sized SUVs. I visited many dealerships I chose Toyota of Santa Barbara because they ultimately had the vehicle that I wanted. I bought what I believe will meet my families needs. The negotiation process was business like and I believe that Frank Flores the sales manager was up front with me and answered my concerns. Be prepared and stick to your position throughout the process.
--------------------
5 STAR FOOD! 
For sure one of if not the best place to get a sandwich on the beach anywhere between St Pete Beach & Clearwater Beach. All orders cooked to order. Super Size, gourmet servings and great very friendly service from the owner. Artison sandwiches for the price of Subway. Great cook with well seasoned sauces and dips usually. I always go for the daily special. Today was 3 Shrimp taco's for $6.00 The shrimp were cooked perfectly and served on fresh corn tortillas with a Kiwi sauce with some fresh peppers. Just enough spice and fruit with the shrimp. DELICIOUS. I could have had 6 they were so good. Only drawback is this place is walk up with only bench seating outside. Not a problem given the food quality for me personally but some may p[refer to sit at a table. It's on the bench or to go. A great place if you are staying at one of the local hotel to walk to. I hear they will start delivering soon. This is a local favorite for me.
The only reason I did not give 5 stars overall as the seating may be an issue for some.
--------------------
A GREAT EXPERIENCE!!!!!!!!!  I was a completely new customer.  I did not have an appointment because my other plans got rained out and my dealership was too busy to take me.  I needed a PA State & Emissions  inspection which I dread because they can be a total ripoff at some places when they add things on and I just wanted to get it over with.  I saw that this place had much better reviews on Yelp than many other shops in the area.  Keystone Discount Tire took my 2008 Pontiac Torrent in for inspection while I waited and had some free coffee.  I only had to get up once to look at some irregular outer front tire wear on my car when it was on the rack during inspection.  I always appreciate it when the technician lets me look at the problem.   It was nothing major.  Easily correctable with an alignment sometime in the future.  Bill was very friendly, knowledgable, and straightforward with his overall analysis of my car.  My car was fully inspected and stickered in less than an hour without my bill being jacked up with add-ons.   I recommend getting on their mailing list for their coupons!!!!!!!!!!
--------------------
My boyfriend and I decided to stop by for lunch yesterday, and I am so glad we did. I ordered a side of beans, chips and salsa, and guacamole. He ordered two steak tacos and a side of rice. The beans are hands down my favorite I've had from a mexican restaurant.  My only complaint is that, unfortunately you do not get a very big portion. The salsa is so fresh tasting and delicious-very cilantro forward, and the chips were nice, thick and crunchy without being oily at all. Take note though, chips and salsa are not included with your purchase and must be bought separately. Now let me get to the best part-the made to order, chunky guacamole. The hardy chips would definitely withstand this heavy duty guac, but I opted instead for tortillas as my vessel to stuff it with along with my beans and salsa. The hot sauces were anything but, though admittedly my tolerance to spices may be higher than the average persons. While I had a great eating experience, my boyfriend did not. He said the meat was of low quality and quite flavorless. He did say he would give it another shot though!
--------------------
Love this little shop so much for so many reasons. First off, whenever I'm on my way to Sweet Divas, I can smell the spices wafting from this little, inviting shop. Second, they have such a large range of spices that you can smell, taste a little, and purchase. Yes, there's a large overwhelming variety of spices, but fear not! Their knowledgeable staff is available and more than happy to assist you in finding the right spice you are looking for all your cooking needs. Over the years I've purchased many items from here and I can attest that they do last a long time (about a year, year and a half, including some stuff I use often!). I see all kind of specialty salts for example (onion salt, celery salt) as well as sugars and powders (lavender vanilla sugar, vanilla bean powder). Their products even seem to taste fresher (I can taste a difference between their cinnamon and nutmeg and what I can get at a dollar store, for example). The prices aren't too bad and they last long. My three bottles pictured cost about $19, but that will last a good year, so its worth it to me.
--------------------
Stayed here three nights on business.  The property is located very close to the airport but you really don't hear it.  The rooms are standard TownePlace Suite rooms with a refrigerator, stove, etc..  The area in which the hotel is located is quiet with a combination of other hotels and office buildings.  It's about a 20 minute drive to the downtown or university area.  About 5-10 minutes from Pima Air Museum.  There are not too many restaurants close by but there are some fast food options and a sandwich place called Baggins that was really good and within walking distance.  The staff of the hotel was really friendly and helpful.  The breakfast is standard continental with a couple of hot options. They also have a reception on weekday evenings.  My only complaint is that the food and drink go quickly so get there early.  You could use this as a dinner if you wanted.  I got there about 45 minutes after it started and although there was food left there were very few soft drinks left (no diet).  They could improve by keeping the area stocked throughout the period.  Anyway, the rooms are nice, beds are comfortable and area is safe.
--------------------
I've come from Cali where boba is very common there. However I was thinking this place would have had the same feel. After being told this place branched off from California, I was disappointed. 

I'm more of a natural person. I enjoy real flavor, real fruits, and of course the perfect boba. I notice that some flavors were used by real fruits but others were just powder which I could definitely taste the different. Especially the taro flavor, being one of my favorites. 

But, if you're not too concern about natural vs powder flavor then this place could be good for you. They ask what level you would like you sweetness and any additional add-ons you would like. I always get boba but sometimes the grass jelly is pretty good too! I'd recommend you try. 

This is also a good place to catch up, talk, play board, card games and even do homework. I know it's always busy with students from the U of A and being told from them it's a nice area to just hang out, that's a pretty good sign. 

Maybe I'm just too picky, but I think it could be better. 

"See it, taste it, Yelp it"

Having stayed here several times, it is my favorite hotel. The staff is excellent. Really exceptional. Everyone from housekeeping to front desk staff to valets.

Rooms are clean, heating and AC are quiet, beds are very comfortable and they make it feel special.

Special K is awesome. I cannot say enough about how wonderful and helpful he has been over all of our visits. One of the best reasons to visit this hotel. Did I mention the exceptional staff?

Turn-down service is Sucre chocolates on your pillow. Sweets for the sweet dreams.

The bathroom wasn't as slippery this time. 

This was the first time we used the valet service and it worked great. No more than a 10 minute wait for the car. You can text them from your phone and they text back with how long it will take.

They also hosted a Gold Status reception. We made a brief appearance on our way to a Mardi Gras ball.

Our only glitch was a mini-bar charge on our bill. We didn't consume any of their food or drink and they happily removed it from the bill.

We will be back. Note to hotel: please put Louis back in the elevator.
--------------------
I have been to a number of dog friendly hotels...just not in the city and did not know what to expect. Usually they are motel like.  This one was in the heart of the city.

I walked tentatively into the hotel lobby as i have a labrador/golden mix who is not easy to hide.

We got to the front desk to register and i was still feeling uneasy although my  bf had assured me it was a dog friendly hotel. Reception was so nice immediately putting us at ease. As we checked in an attendant asked if Bentley could have treats which she fullly enjoyed. The Reception person also asked if we would like a welcome kit for Bentley. Holy moly. Of course. Dog dishes, a mat, treats, etc. I was blown away.  

Plus the guests at the hotel all stopped to compliment and pet "queen Bentley". Our room was on the top floor. Awesome!

Even when i went to walk her the car attendants greeted her by name. We were so impressed with the service we decided to come back an extra night. 

Thank you Loews. I didnt realize a hotel could be so dog friendly especially to a big dog.
--------------------
Although there are countless little Mexican places below Washington Avenue, I never get sick of them and always look forward to trying the new kid on the block. This time it was El Sabor Poblano on Federal, which could not look less special if it tried.

I liked that there were 3 fish tacos on the menu.  I picked the fried and battered version, though the tortilla chip covered fish could have been awesome. I was instantly impressed when I opened one of my three and found that El Sabor puts an entire filet of fish in each taco! The flakey meat had no fishy taste. These tacos came with the more American toppings of lettuce and, tomato, and cheese. I bet I could have gotten cilantro and onion if I asked. The sole staff member in the place seemed happy to accommodate us- well, we were the only ones dining in.

Another taco filling option that comes with more traditional toppings is the super crispy chorizo, only $8 for 3. There was no detectable gristle here, something I have often come across at this little places.

As unassuming as it looks, this particular South Philly Mexican place is worth stopping by.
--------------------
I thoroughly enjoyed the ambiance. The decor was modern and cozy. The lighting was appropriate for dinner but terrible for selfies lol. Our waiter was OK. He seemed to be very hyper and impatient. I almost felt like he was rushing to take care of us instead of genuinely trying to give us an experience. I ordered the Shrimp Breaux Bridge and it was tasty. Nothing to phone home about but it was good. My friend ordered the Balsamic Salmon and it was good as well. It kind of reminded me of an Asian dish. Another friend had the Pesto Crusted Idaho Trout. It was cooked and flavored very nicely. 

I also ordered the Zangria White which is a sangria that was supposed to include strawberries, blueberries and diced apples... and i only got apples. IF there is an item on the menu that contains SEASONAL FRUITS AND VEGGIES ETC.... DISCLOSE SOMEWHERE ON THE MENU THAT THOSE THINGS ARE OUT OF SEASON. It definitely wouldve made a difference in my drink order. But overall the sangria was OK. 

I would go back because Im sure the service is better that what I experienced and I have heard amazing things about the menu.

My husband reserved a Corolla-sized car over the internet ten days ahead of time. When we arrived at Avis Rent A Car at the Reno airport I asked if the rental could be upgraded to a Camry-size vehicle. They offered us two different kinds of cars and finally we got the Camry we wanted. The man was very professional and in the end told us the rental would be $800.00 for five days. I felt the price was very high, however we had gone through most of the paperwork. I had already selected to get the $25.00 a day insurance which came to $150.00 with tax. We were very happy with the car and had no problems with it. During our vacation I decided to talk to an Avis representative when we dropped the car off. I asked her if a weekly rate would be less expensive. She said it would be $15.00 more. She said the upgrade cost an extra $20.00 a day. I will not rent from Avis any more. Next time I will go to Hertz or Dollar and make the reservation over the phone. Looking back, i would not have gotten the extra insurance. My personal insurance covers everything.
--------------------
Just visited The Fat Ham with my girlfriend about an hour ago. The place is small, but the vibe is nice. Music isn't too loud, the staff welcomed us and the whiskey display is impressive. We couldn't get a table, so we took the two empty seats at the bar. The bartender, Dan, greeted us immediately. Dan was effecient, quick and friendly. Great service. My girlfriend ordered a margarita, which was reasonably priced and tasty. To eat, we ordered the pimento cheese, skillet cornbread, shrimp & grits and the hot chicken. Everything was delicious. The pimento cheese had some heat, and the country bread it is served with gives it a nice touch of salt. The mollases butter on the cornbread was "to die for". The shrimp & grits was my favorite dish. Creamy grits, perfectly cooked and seasoned shrimp. As for the chicken, they do not lie to you. It is hot. The brioche and ranch dressing compliment it well. For desert, we ordered the raspberry cobbler and a coffee. The cobbler was underwhelming. It wasn't bad - just not as great as the previous plates. Elixr coffee was spot on. Overall, I'll be back. Decent price point, high end comfort food and great service.
--------------------
From the second you walk in the door, you're greeted by the adorable woman at the counter. It seems if you come in here more than once a week, she'll know you're name but I haven't been so lucky since my visits are a bit more sporadic.

My most recent discovery are the vegetarian breakfast sandwiches, which are served all day! I particularly enjoy veg. sausage w/ havarti on an everything bagel. I could actually go for one right about now... I've also had the veggie club sandwich and my other half has enjoyed the chicken cheesesteak hoagie and the chicken salad on a croissant. Everything always taste fresh, they are priced really well  (I think my favorite bagel sandwich I mentioned is $2.09-2.99- cheaper than wawa!). The people at the deli are super helpful, offering menus if you can't read the one on the wall and will make great suggestions and accommodations to your needs and want.

Don't forget to grab a really great snack too while you're there- they have amazing chocolate bars, an incredible drink case, tons of chip varieties and those addictive hi-chew candies in every flavor.

I know i'll be back here, who doesn't like fast / delicious / attentive service?

Chef Kevin Sbraga knows fried chicken. My first exposure to his succulent birds was the hot chicken at The Fat Ham. Lo and behold, his lavender honey fried chicken tops its spicy cousin. The chicken is brined in buttermilk, dredged in seasoned flour and sits for ten minutes. It's then coated with a second round of flour and dropped into the fryer. The chicken (breast, wing, thigh, drumstick) is drizzled with lavender honey and sprinkled with salt and ground pink peppercorns. It comes with a buttermilk biscuit, whipped honey-thyme butter, and red bliss potato salad. It is some of the best fried chicken I've eaten in a long time. Crunchy, crispy coating on the outside with a juicy, moist inside. The sweet honey glaze is truly outstanding and finger lickin' good. The biscuit is awesome. I would definitely order this dish again and again. I got the salty but delicious fried smelts with chili pepper aioli as an appetizer. My friend Chris W got the filet mignon and butter poached king crab surf and turf. For dessert, I had a slice of salted pecan pie and he had the ice cream sundae. Every dish at Juniper Commons was top-notch. Chef Sbraga does it again!

Great ice cream, absolutely terrible service. My son and I went in for ice cream on a Sunday afternoon, so maybe they have their worst staff working on a Sunday. We walked in and were ignored by both people behind the counter. The girl (who seemed drunk) was throwing screwed up napkins around and one of them flew over the counter and hit me. No big deal, but no apology, just more hysterically loud laughter and napkin throwing. The guy noticed my son eyeing the candy and yelled at him not to touch anything. I get it, no one wants sandy little hands in the candy. But he wasn't touching anything, so this was just rude. We stood at the counter and the girl begrudgingly served us, no smile, no greeting, she didn't even look at us. Perhaps she was annoyed we had interrupted her flirting. She ran my card and then turned her back to do some weird dance for her work mate while we stood and waited, more loud shouty laughter. I'm all about a great fun atmosphere and I know I sound like a bore. But when it comes hand-in-hand with a rude attitude towards paying customers, it crosses a line.
--------------------
I went to this location because it's easy to get in and out even tho it is a busy corner. This is my second visit. My first visit was mediocre. The woman who assisted me was not really friendly (sorry I didn't get names at either visit) but was helpful and professional. My second visit I was assisted by a different woman who was also helpful, knowledgeable and professional. I realized the women were not being rude; they are just quiet. Neither woman made small talk but answered every question I had. 
Now my second visit deserved 5 stars. I normally pack things myself and just need it shipped, but I was shipping a skateboard and could not box it correctly. The woman went above and beyond to help me and she offered more assistance than was professionally required.  I will return to this location for all my shipping needs.
The store is clean, and packs (no pun intended) a lot of product into a small space. The staff is knowledgeable. They have boxes, packing materials, and offer copying services. You may not get a big smile and a lot of small talk, but you will get the highest level of service. In my opinion.
--------------------
I have been coming here for about a year now and this last week was my 5th visit. I live in the Bay Area. I'm a player card member so they send me free room or discounted room offers all the time. This is a very nice hotel/ casino. Never had a bad experience. Love that I can check in online before getting to to hotel and just use the express kiosk when I get there to get my room keys and avoid the long line,  LOVE THAT! The rooms are always nice and clean and comfortable. The last 2 rooms I have stayed in had views of the pool which was nice! 
The pool is very nice and relaxing and never too crowded. The spa Toscana is very nice but a bit pricey. None of the restaurants I have tried there so far have been great but I haven't tried to steakhouse or Chi yet, so I haven't had the full experience yet. The slots are never too crowded when I go and can usually get on the machines I like to play with little to no delay. 
I enjoy visiting here. I will keep returning as long as they keep sending me sweet offers!!
--------------------
On my first day in New Orleans, I walked to Fair Grinds for a caffeine boost. It was a beautiful afternoon, and a handful of people were scattered around the shop and the outdoor seating area, working on laptops and visiting with friends. 

I ordered a small cold brew with vanilla, easy on the ice. I added a hunk of gluten free zucchini bread (the bread butt; the best part!) to my order and paid with a credit card. They have a fancy touchscreen register that lets you add tip to your card purchase. 

I topped off my drink with whole milk -- which in itself was a real treat. It's so rare to see whole milk at the mixing station! 

Before leaving, I asked what else they had in the way of a GF offering, and the young man behind the counter said "just the zucchini bread." That's a real bummer; the zucchini bread is great but I'd love to have more than one option. 

My drink was smooth and had a perfect flavor. I was happy with my choices. 

If I lived in the neighborhood, I'd be here all the time. I like the hipstery feeling of this place, and everything I've ordered has been delightful.
--------------------
I have been here twice for breakfast.  The set-up is really awkward and it's clear the people running it on Saturday mornings don't really know what they're doing.  It's stressful to hear them cursing under their breath and yelling at their line cook, Carlos.  

You are instructed to order at the counter....except ocassionally, for certain clients, they'll actually come to your table and take your order ...but it seems pretty random.  It's all self serve (shitty) coffee and bottled beverages.  After a long time with the sun beating down on you (there are no shades for front window), the food arrives and it's Ok.  there was a lot of grizzle in my pulled pork texas wrap,  but the cornbread pancakes were tasty.  

You then pay afterwards---why not just pay when you get it?  I would like to minimize my face time with the awkward people who staff it on Saturday A.M.s, but no such luck. 

I brought my out-of-town brother here for brunch and regret it.  it's somewhat tasty, but kind of a dive.  Don't go here if you expect a nice/traditional b-fast service (i.e. a waiter and people who fill up your coffee.)  That said, it's pretty cheap so, guess you get what you paid for.
--------------------
Oh Chickie's and Pete's, you are the perfect place to watch some sports and indulge. 

No doubt this is not the best food I've ever had but, if you can get a seat, grab some beer with mussels red and crab fries, there's no way not to thoroughly enjoy this place during a game or any time you're down by the stadiums. 

My favs are the crab fries, mussels red (white is overloaded with garlic that I can't always take it), the spicy pull and peel shrimp, steamers, and if the mood is right the blue crabs (it's a lot of work but tasty). This place also makes getting down and dirty with your food easy. There are sinks all over so you can rinse the mess off your hands once you're done....good touch.

To sum it up, Chickie's and Pete's is a Philadelphia institution and always a good time. I strongly suggest going at least once to enjoy the experience. 

Please note: Make sure to remember two things before coming during major sporting events. 1. You'll never get a table and 2. You'll deal with a ton of drunk people. I've absolutely been one of these people before and we can get annoying unless you're in the right frame of mind. :)
--------------------
Ick.  That sums up my experience at Dinardo's in one "word."  Dinardo's gave me that "Ick" vibe the minute I set my foot in the door. THough we were greeted by a very friendly hostess, the place looked like a run down diner on the interior--and it wasn't very clean or charming.  This would have been fine because a lot of times the "run down" places have the best "authentic food," but this was not the case at Dinardo's.  At Dinardo's you do not get what you pay for as the prices are rather high and the food quality is rather low.    Our server hated his life and made snarky, mean comments throughout our time there which, though entertaining, was kind of unwelcome and unpleasant.  My friend had the mussels which were puny and in an unimpressive sauce--unimpressive being the general adjective I would use to describe any given dish my party ordered.  I had a soup which was extremely salty and bland beyond that and the broiled flounder and "seafood imperial" dishes were OK at best. 

I'd say if you're looking for good seafood you'd be better off at any BYOB; little fish, audrey claire, ANYWHERE but Dinardo's.  I don't understand how this place is still in business, to be honest.
--------------------
I've often passed this swanky little place in Downtown filled with good-looking professionals laughing over drinks, appetizers and spilling over the sidewalk

NOM NOMS
Although you probably won't get full on the sizes, the food is like little art works of flavor. My bowl of mussels and clams was HUGE and I sopped up the buttery, faintly spiced broth with the accompanying breadstick. Well done. The other appetizers like Tuna Tartare and Coconut Shrimp each had awesome flavor surprises - fresh, melty tuna and a wasabi and jam sauce respectively - both excellent and plated beautifully.

My cocktail "The Tryst" didn't impress. Watery and a strange alcohol after taste. I'll forget it tomorrow. 

SERVICE
Thanks Yelp for introducing me here. It's easy to get overlooked at the bar, but once seated, our server was quick and helpful and was great at lowering my inhibitions by telling me what to expect in a "vegetable" beer they offered--spot on. 

SUMMARY
I'll probably stick to the drinks only here because the food prices are above my range... or go during happy hours. Cool, hip place to bring the girlfriends or if you're looking for impressive, gutsy art dishes with good taste.... and if you have cash to blow (but I won't let that subtract a review star)
--------------------
It was my fiance's birthday and he decided he wanted a good, laid back Thai restaurant for dinner. Yelp steered us in the Jasmine Rice direction, and it was definitely a good decision. We wanted the summer rolls, which were on the menu, but apparently will not be available until summer, so we settled on the pan-fried dumplings. The flavor was good, but I don't think we'd order them again. We got the green curry fried rice with duck and chicken pad thai. Both of those dishes were great, but the duck stole the show. That was some the of tastiest duck I've ever had. The pad thai was a bit sweet for us, so I think we'd try a different noodle dish when we return. But it was still very good, especially with some chili sauce mixed in. Our service was good, but other people had issues. One table was rushing to get to a show at the Kimmel Center and waited quite a while for their meal (and were going to be late). Another person who got take-out was missing one of their items (but the owner realized it and called him and walked the dish to his house, which was very nice). Overall, good quality Thai! We would definitely go back.
--------------------
Brother Rabbit you are young, hip, and tasty!

Met friends for drinks and an early dinner. I was the first to arrive so I sat at the bar and ordered the house cider which is great and I followed that with the Oban 18 which is phenomenal so try it while you're there. 

Our dinner kicked off with the most amazing house biscuits and butter that will have you begging for the recipe.

The rest of our dinner was comprised of several selections from the First course menu. We had the daily oysters which were great. Followed by the Brussels sprouts, delicious but the crispy chicken skins were a bit of a let down, they needed more flavor. 

The smoked tuna tartar is great but the sweet chips can overwhelm the dish. Definitely get the marinated shrimp and jalapeño jus it is a wonderfully fresh and bright dish. 

To close thing up we had the dobeger cake with lemon curd and chocolate ice cream, as if that wasn't enough they pour this amazing chocolate sauce on it when it arrives that will have you just dying as you wait to dig in.

Overall Compere Lapin is a great addition to the New Orleans food scene, great for groups or date night with your significant other.
--------------------
We came here for an early mothers day celebration as we were on the quest to find a nail salon that could accommodate 4 pedicures at the same time. They were very friendly and even though they didn't have 4 pedicurists on the schedule that day they added one to accommodate us. That was really nice of them as they could have easily told us no. 

The place itself is decorated very modern and offers a very clean, minimalist atmosphere. Upon walking in we were immediately greeted and after we checked in with the front desk we were asked what we wanted to drink. They had complimentary mimosas, wine and champagne, the perfect way to begin to unwind. Once we picked out our polish colors we were well on our way to getting our pedicures. Everyone was so nice and made us feel comfortable and welcomed. My polish never chipped the whole time I had it on. I will definitely be back. 

The only downside is that its street parking only, which isn't something that they can control. They told us most of their business comes from people who work in the CBD so parking probably isn't an issue for their regular customers. Aside from parking being an issue I would definitely go to Buff again.
--------------------
I've been here a handful of times and it's always because I don't have time to go to VN Nails near Costco where I prefer to go (they get 5 stars from me).  Kiwi Nail has always done a cheap job trying to take shortcuts wherever possible.  But today I've had it and will never go back!  After getting the typical shabby job on a fill with French tips,  I accidentally smudged two nails really badly.  They needed to be repainted and I asked her to do so... I even offered to pay extra.  The nail tech came over to look and she pressed the clumps back down and painted right back over the mess (didn't even keep the paint in the lines) then slathered so much varnish over the train wreck that it was literally dripping down my finger. After my nails were dry enough to leave,  another tech rang me up and the receipt had no place for a tip.  When I asked,  he told me I had to pay tips in cash... Well it's lucky for me I didn't have any cash.  He said I will have to tip her next time.  NEXT TIME??!!  yeah right!  There will be no next time! Save yourself the hassle and don't bother with this d@mn place!
--------------------
I was having an bad migraine and felt terrible. When woke up I had a sinus infection and my day was just going awful. I called a few places to try to get a massage in today because I knew indeed it badly. No one had any availability and I stumbled across massage envy on Google and thought to give them a try. Not only were they able to fit me in with the exact specific type I needed, but they also were able to fit my father in at the exact same time. Jen was understanding and nice, she asked me questions and checked up on me constantly. She even showed me some at home techniques I could use. She took her time, obviously did not rush. Carrie, I believe, was the name of the woman who did a foot massage on my father. He was very pleased and recommended I try it sometime. They also informed me about the membership program which not only is very cost-efficient, but also adheres to my busy schedule. I signed up on the spot with no hesitation. Friendly staff, great atmosphere, comfortable building and very calming environment! Would recommended! I feel so much better already and am going back in a month to get a 90 minute massage.
--------------------
The new Han Dynasty took over the spot where the old Mid-Atlantic restaurant (with the unchanging menu) was. I like the Han Dynasty here a lot more than the one in Olde City even if I give both 4*. Maybe I'm biased, because I love the service here. They've always been very nice, and came over to check in with me and just make some small conversation when they heard I had a peanut allergy (even though they had no peanuts in any of the dishes I ordered; I think it was Han's sister?). I've been to this Han Dynasty more times in a month than the number of times I've been to the other.

Note though, that the different branches have different specialties. I heard the dan dan mian in Olde City is the best, but the one in UC isn't so good (I wouldn't know since it has peanuts). Overall, I think it;s okay food wise, still not spicy enough as with the other branch. But I like the layout and atmosphere a lot more.

Next, if you go during lunch, you can ask for lunch portions, that are smaller than the dinner portions, and half the menu price! So it's a great lunch place too, alone, or in a group of 2 or 3.
--------------------
Uhhhhh.... Not sure how to quantify or qualify my experience here. Let's start with back story: 

My sister was visiting for the weekend, so I wanted to show her a solid night on the town that lasted till the wee hours of the morning. We started on Frenchmen, but for whatever reason it was dead. 
Deciding to adventure Uptown we proceeded on a respectable bar crawl, including Delachaise, Columns, and St. Joes, however, at 3 AM the usual Uptown culprits start to raise their heads. A summary of the following dialogue:

Friends "Let's go to FMs" 
Me: "No, too much broken glass"
Friends: "Let's go to Snake and Jake's"
Me: "Eh...."
Friends: "Brothers 3?"
Me: "I'm afraid I'll hit my head on the ceiling"
Friends: "The Saint!!"
Me: "I suppose I haven't been there before, I'm curious."

After entering the Saint the look on my sisters face was priceless, akin to a deer in headlights look. I kept my countenance, and we ordered a round. Things proceeded as expected ... unwanted dance grinding advances, check! uber drunk guy talking your ear off, check! Big Buck Hunter, CHECK!!! Overall I'm glad I moderately traumatized my sister and sated my curiosity in the same night. 

Helpful hint: They have outdoor seating, surprisingly, which is very good to escape the smoke
--------------------
Stopped here last week while in the area from Burbank. Had read about it on Trip Advisor. It is in a great location, quiet, peaceful and cool under the shade of the big old trees. For its location and it being noon on a Thursday we were surprised to find there was literally only one table open when we walked in. Food is served pretty quick though so it didn't seem anyone was really waiting. 
Based on reviews we had read, my hubby had the tri-tip sandwich. I ordered the buffalo burger. I have to say that was one of the best burgers I have ever had in my life. As usual, we traded tastes of our orders. My hubby was so jealous of my buffalo burger and I heard about it several more times throughout the day, that he should've got the burger. The tri-tip was quite dry, and it was literally just the meat on bread, big bread.  The horseradish sauce (served on the side) was very tasty though.
For the tri-tip, I give a 3, hubby gives a 4. We both give the buffalo burger a definite 5++.

Either way, worth checking out if you want something with a unique atmosphere and that is away from town but not a long drive. Very peaceful.
--------------------
So, I went back to El Arado on Monday with a group of six people. The staff seemed shocked about our 6 pm arrival, and "sanitized" a large table for us quickly. Yes, the table smelled like dirty sanitized rags, ugh, but, once you got buzzed on...I mean beyond, the smell, your waiter will appear and take your drink orders. 

We got beers and margaritas. The margarita drinker in the group declared that it "was good."  The prices for drinks weren't that bad.  ($2.95 for Mexican beers). 

We all ordered our food, which was brought out at a good time, fresh, and hot. Everyone snarfed - it was good and tasty and all our needs were met attentively by the quiet waiter. 

All of us were let satisfied, and our specific requests (i.e. "no beans" "light on the cheese") were met by the kitchen staff with no problems. We left with full bellies then went to the Red Garter for a mind-numbing strip club experience. 

What a way to wrap up a review..

El Arado has gotten a bad wrap - but, the staff is decent, the food wasn't too shabby and the drink prices are cheap. A good place to start out for affordable and filling eats before a night out in Fountain Square (or to strip clubs).
--------------------
This is the worst. My first time at an Econo anything. Playing nice for group purposes. We get here. They check us in like the rooms are clean. The rooms are dirty. The lady comes to clean the room because apparently they dont have any others clean or available. Go figure. So the manager comes outside to look as if we are lying about dirty rooms. It's hot as hell outside, wasps everywhere and we're standing here. I asked about other clean rooms and he (a-hole manager) (neil Patel) sarcastically states check in is at 2. It's 1:45 though. If you're going to check guest in at least make sure the rooms are clean or let them know it will be a few. So I'm standing outside in the heat as they apparently clean the room.  They took no cleaner in to clean counters, bathroom, etc. Just nasty. Then they just looked in the microwave & fridge to see if it was clean. They didn't wipe nothing. I would never stay at this filthy mofo or any Econo Lodge. Just nasty. Go w/ a big brand like Marriot, Starwood or Hilton where customer satisfaction is part of their branding scope. This -ish is for the birds and folks who need a place for a quickie.... Not even that.
--------------------
I visited this restaurant 4 times during my 5 days stay. Crazy, right? Here are a list of reasons/pros:

- We were staying a nearby hotel.
- The restaurant opens 11 - 10:30 pretty much every day including new year's day so it fits into our schedule.
- If you are a party of two, chances are you get seated right away.
- $9 per dozen of oysters which is a really great deal by any standard!
- They have a seafood shop next door that sells boiled and fresh seafood to- go.
- Our server (same) is very friendly and recognized us every single time.

Now I want to talk about the reasons why I only give it 3 stars.

- We tried a bunch of stuff which are all pretty mediocre. Raw oysters are not cleaned well. So if your schedule is flexible, go to Superior Seafood during their happy hours for their 50 cents/oyster - better quality and cheaper. Turtle soup has a strange taste so I definitely prefer Felix's. A portion of my boiled shrimps are always mushy somhow, maybe boiled for too long?...
- The ambient is inviting but not comfortable so we basically just finished our food and go. 
- Clean the bathroom!!

Will probably visit again if we stay in the area next time or simply just pick up some seafood quickly.
--------------------
I really wanted to like Casselli's, but it wasn't in the cards. Maybe I just caught them on a bad night, but I didn't really enjoy much about my visit. The waiter was very unpleasant - was banging down the plates and glasses on the table when he delivered them. Maybe he was having a bad day, but I still would have expected better. 

We had mixed experiences with the food. Mine and our friends' was OK, but my wife's baked ravioli would have been more use to a hockey team for use as pucks. They were really overdone - woefully overdone. 

The worst part was that our table was next to the opera singer guy. He was singing extremely loudly and it was nigh impossible to maintain a conversation - especially coupled with how close we were to the table next to us and their attempts to speak over Opera Guy.

Part of me wants to give them another chance (since I hate writing bad reviews) and the other part is annoyed over the waiter's attitude. I probably will not go back. There are so many good Italian restaurants worth visiting that the opportunity cost of returning to Casselli's seems too high.

On the upside, they have somewhat convenient parking in the lot behind the restaurant (near the Shawmont School).

Note: cash-only.
--------------------
Define the worst Mediterranean food I have ever had.  The hummus appeared to have a good texture, that is the little bit I could see under the ocean of olive oil.  The pita bread was burned- not just over toasted, but black on the majority of the wedges.  I went home and was sick the rest of the evening from the amount of oil it had in it. 

The manager was probably the worst of the experience. He told my gf he would "upgrade her hummus for no charge, because normally it's $1.00" but said it as if he was doing us this huge favor.  He then continued to yell at us from across the restaurant after we sat down  (instead of coming up to our table and actually having a conversation) and says, "please let me know how your food is because that's the only way I can know if we are doing a good job or not is when customers tell me."  But we agreed that the vibe he gave off would not be that of open mindedness and gratitude if we were to say anything about his plate of olive oil, er I mean hummus.  There is also a sign that advertises the "cleanest bathroom in town".... Ehhhh ok, good to know for our next road trip.
--------------------
My sister-in-law and I visited this restaurant on 8/28/15 mid afternoon.  We were seated after requested 3 times that the hostess speak a little louder because we couldn't even hear her with the background music.  We were seated in a booth with a never ending Larry King vitamin commercial on the TV - really?  Our waitress introduced herself and a new trainee and then we never saw her again.  Two other wait staff seemed to be sharing our table, but no idea who was responsible for our table.  We got our drinks and ordered, but food took forever considering there was not more than 15-20 filled tables in the entire restaurant.  Burgers were not bad - I ordered the blue cheese burger and it would have been better with less blue cheese, way too much!  Fries and onion sticks were very good.  But no one came to see if we were satisfied, needing anything, etc and took two requests and waiting to get a carry out box.  There was a family seated across the aisle from us when we arrived and we assumed they had finished their meal and were "hanging out".  Only after we received our food did we understand they had already ordered and still did not have their food!  I doubt I will return to this restaurant in the future.
--------------------
Cashier was trying to put a beer on my to go order and I did not get the fish taco I ordered.

They have nice setting and the establishment seems to be fairly nice, it has got tvs, a bar, a number of tables in various sizes, and a downtown street patio complete with fire heaters for cold nights.

I had the sonoran dog and received two beef tacos that I did not ask for.  The tacos has scraps of beef with cilantro and onion.  They also have the regular styled tacos with tomatoes and lettuce.  The dog was the last one sitting the bin and a bit soggy.  Compared to truck dogs, it does not compare.  The tacos were simply bits of beef with onion and cilantro, nothing impressive and nothing like what is seen in the pictures.

Perhaps, my disappointing experience was due to how the place was packed, had a line out the door by the time I left, and was somewhat loud, but that is no excuse for the terrible eating experience.  They were starting to run out of the beef and dog that I ordered when I got in at the end of a fairly short line, i would hate to think how much worst if I came in a bit later for the dinner rush.
--------------------
Amazing food!! and  the whole experience is great there every time. I suggest going there with a  group of about 6 people so it doesn't totally break the bank but if you've got the money then who cares! Have fun!

First you enter in and select the wine you would like. The staff is helpful and knowledgeable about their stock. (And if for some reason at the end you didn't  finish your bottle they will cork it back up for you to take.) Then select your cheese platter. Lots of yummy stinky cheese to select  from and prosciutto. I wish they had more cured meats but it's all yummy anyway. You pay for the wine and cheese there. Which in a large group one or two people can take care of this  part. 

Then going to get a seat can be difficult but just be patient. There's outdoor seating that's very nice and always a live band playing. Inside upstairs is nice as well. Once you're all set with your wine and group it's time to order. Go to the window and play your order. Definite things you must get.... the bacon wrapped dates stuffed with chorizo and the goat cheese and mushroom dish....AMAZING! Although everything I've ever had here is great. 

Then just wait for your cheese platter, food and enjoy!
--------------------
The line was out the door, but I had a sandwich in my hands 7 minutes later, and I'm guessing it took longer because I didn't know what I wanted right away.  In fact, I felt a little rushed.  All the locals were running in, saying hi to the owner and ordering up their usual's.  No place for a rookie, but they were extremely patient with us and a few others that wandered in not knowing what they were doing either.

As soon as you cross the threshold, you know you have made a good choice, the smell makes your mouth water.  The Punk agreed so we decided to sit inside (everyone else was outside).

Typically, I would never ever order pastrami, but the menu said it was lean, so I tried something different for me.  Lean indeed.  Best pastrami I have had in a very long time.  In fact, maybe ever.  

The punk was amazed at all the bottle caps glued to every surface in the place.  It is a visual feast to keep you busy and entertained while you eat, if you choose to eat inside.  You cannot see the walls for all the nostalgic fodder.

She was especially thrilled when they brought out her sandwich. When he set it down she exclaimed with delight, "He knew exactly what I wanted!"
--------------------
this place was awful. the first time my mother and I went we were very excited because everyone had been talking about it and we want to support local business. The day we went it happened to be pouring raining. So we are standing there at the hostess stand cold and wet waiting to be seated. Not only was the hostess not there, no one even acknowledged that we were there. The bartender who was right next to he stand was on his blue tooth and only looked our way to flirt with me. My mom was so annoyed we just left. 

The second time we went was because we were going to be in the area and we decided to give it a second try. We were seated right away and the music was really good. The waiter could have cared less about our table. he acted like we were doing him a favor by even coming to the table. The menu was thin and nothing to really choose from. when he eventually brought the food it was decent. My mom hated her salmon cakes because they were overly breaded and poorly season. it honestly looked like two pieces of bread. 

It was overpriced for what we had. I WOULD NEVER RECOMMEND THIS PLACE. The take out makes great dog food though.
--------------------
All I needed was a written estimate.  A rather simple task one would think.  I needed my factory navigation unit in my Denali replaced, and needed to know costs and in writing.  Now this is a normal standard procedure for an auto repair shop.  Let's just assume its bad (it is), so tell me how much it is to remove bad part, and put the new one in.

Jay Fatimo or something like that, said he was very busy, as were the other service writers, so he handed me his card, and said to just email him with what I needed.  Sounded like a good plan, I wasn't in a big rush.  So I did just that, sent a picture of my vin, and the appropriate RPO codes to know what part I needed, and emailed it all to him.  I never got a response.  I tried again about a week or so later, still nothing.  Made sure it is his email at the dealership, etc.  

I guess I have a hard time with taking my car in or trusting a place to do such repairs (3000 dollar job according to Winkel GMC) if they can't even respond to an email.  He knew I would email that day, and I did.  

I guess the GMC dealer right next door gets my money instead.
--------------------
Quality of this store has gone downhill over the past few years. In the past,  I was able to easily choose from a wide selection of food at reasonable prices any time of day. I have noticed recently that the produce is not as fresh, but more expensive,  and the prices of the organic foods are more expensive than Whole Foods. This morning I debated on going to Wegmans or going to this store. I only had to get a few items so I decided on this Giant since it was closer. Big mistake. I have seen on average at least 3 or 4 people shopping around 5 a.m. In the past but today just me. They had all of the store roped off where it was impossible to get to certain aisles and very difficult to get to the register. In my frustration I went under a rope to get soup.  I was then berated by a number of people who were supposed to be cleaning the floors but some were just standing around doing nothing. I couldn't even walk out of the closest door because that was blocked off. If they needed to clean the floor they should have closed the store for a few hours. It would have taken less time at Wegmans which is where I will shop for now on.
--------------------
I stopped by Bell Meade during a recent visit to Nashville. The best way for me to describe my experience is to say that the next time I go to Nashville I will go out of my way to make sure I return to Bell Meade.

On my travels, I tend to stop from time to time to see if I can find specific bourbons that may be out locally. At this time of year, I did not expect any great finds because many of the items for which I look have their annual release later in the year so it's a surprise to find any of them on the shelf. For example, Elmer T Lee is a favorite of mine so it was one that I asked about.

Despite the fact that I walked away without Elmer T, I still had a great time. I enjoyed a few tastes at the tasting bar and even better I had a great conversation with Max. He is one of the reasons I will return.

I did walk out with a bottle of Tennessee whiskey cream that is not sold locally and there was a bottle on the shelf that I have not seen locally that I need to investigate. As I said I will return and a five star rating from me should say at all.
--------------------
Service is excellent. Atmosphere is great. The raw bar was fantastic. Those were the best Alaskan crab legs I've had. Well worth splurging for them. 

My friends were drawn in by the awesome looking burger they had, and indeed the burgers were all they hoped for. It came with a generous portion of crispy fries. But if you want anything else besides the $17 burgers, expect to spend over $30 for your entree. While the ambience feels and looks casual, it is fine dining.

Unfortunately, the waiter did sell the shrimp and grits with the additional crab as "heaven in his mouth", but that it was not. I've had better shrimp and grits in Atlanta, and there is no reasonable way you should be paying $30 for shrimp and GRITS. Without the crab, it was still over $20.

But everything else was great. Drinks were delicious. Everything came out pretty quickly. Oh, when we mentioned we were visiting from out of town, the waiter was nice enough to give us a complimentary appetizer of the cool pizza to start. It was great but the name is hard to say or remember. And the rabbit and chicken liver pate was super worth since it comes in a huge mason jar.

I recommend sticking to the drinks, appetizers, and burgers and you'll be a pretty happy camper.
--------------------
My wife and I had been wanting to go here but just hadn't made it a priority.  

I had the fish and chips.  The batter wasn't thick, and it has a crispiness to it that was a great contrast to the moistness and juiciness of the fish.  I have to admit, when I'm not sure what to get I think of getting a burger or fish & chips, and there weren't any burgers on the dinner menu.  The serving size was 3 cod pieces, approx 4-6 oz, along with a generous serving of fries. Additionally, the tartar sauce appeared to be made in house, had a great flavor.  So, if you're in the mood for fish and chips, I would highly recommend getting them here...because while the serving size isn't as big as Great Basin's, it tastes way better.

My wife had the salmon tacos, and for the side she had the chicken tortilla soup.  While the tacos had some great flavors the salmon was a bit overcooked, thus making the tacos a bit overshadowed by the soup.  Similar to the fish & chips above, the serving size wasn't large, only 2 tacos, but again, the flavors were very good.

If you're starving and want a large meal with leftovers I'd recommend other places, but if you want a satisfying meal that's an appropriate size this place is very good.
--------------------
Excellent food and bar. Slow service.

A friend and I stopped here during an evening of bar hopping in the CBD. We were seated promptly and given our menus, which are half-French, half-English. Not a big deal for anyone who can read French and/or has been living in Louisiana for a reasonable amount of time, but definitely something tourists should be wary of. I didn't have any alcohol because I was the designated driver, but I can say that their drink menu is extensive, and the bar was packed from the moment we arrived until the moment we left. 

This restaurant's biggest strength is it's food. I tasted their crab bisque, and had Poulet Grand-Mère as my entrée. Both were excellent. The latter arrived in a wide cast-iron bowl, which I'm sure has a more proper name, but was an interesting touch nonetheless.

The service was why I gave this restaurant 4/5 instead of 5/5. Most of the wait staff seemed to be interns from culinary school. The handful we dealt with were very friendly, but would do well to be a little more attentive. For example, the server who brought us our desserts ran off before we could ask for spoons to eat the dessert with. 

In summary, a good dining experience, but I think I would rather continue exploring new restaurants in the area before returning.
--------------------
Our server was awesome. Very tentative and extremely nice! That is the only thing saving this place plus the maple wings were delicious. Now for the bad part. We paid 35 dollars for the "piano guys" to sing a song to the birthday girl. We had 3 options of songs that we wanted to hear. They called our birthday girl on stage and began to sing a rendition of Aladins whole new world. (Which was not one of the songs we had picked) The song quickly turned to a absolutely disgusting remake. The piano guy sang so our birthday girl about opening her thighs,tying her up, filling holes, splurging on her face, and cumming in her hair. It was even worse than that. Her husband and family including parents were in the crowd but luckily couldn't hear to well because the sound system is terrible. Our birthday girl even stopped the piano man and told him to stop and he continued and made it even dirtier. It was disgusting, offensive, and embarrassing. Trust me we are not prudes by any means but this was way too far. It completely ruined the experience and we all immediately left. We spent our time and money there only to have the birthday ruined. Also for 35 dollars we paid we only heard 1 of the songs which they only sang  part of.
--------------------
We are frequent patrons who enjoy their super fun bar, tv's and music selection.  The service is very good.  Nice, hard-working, mannerly people in a very cool atmosphere that appreciate the business.  Food is consistently fresh(seafood) and good.  Pizza is the best in South Jersey and my husband, the unofficial pizza 'officianado' makes me try them all, from NYC, to Trenton to Philly, Delaware, Chicago.  This is really the best pizza I've ever had. The crust is thin, crispy yet has a nice chew, and flavorful.

Last night I had a dinner special of chicken cutlet in a lobster, white -truffle oil, light cream sauce with asparagus, shallots and sundried tomatoes over angel hair pasta. On the Special's menu it is listed as a veal entree, but the kitchen was more than happy to substitute Chicken for me. The dish was so delicately seasoned with such a fine touch that I enjoyed smelling it almost as much as tasting it. In addition, it was such a generous portion that I enjoyed it two nights later for dinner and now want to go back tomorrow and order it again!!  What an absolutely fabulous recipe. Very fine, subtle flavor but also comforting and satisfying. 

Not to mention, Selena the Bar Manger, bartenders Jayna and Chris are just so pleasant, professional and helpful, it really is a great place to go!

Enjoy!!

My boyfriend and I have lived in trolley square for about three months now and tend to stick to the same restaurants.  We went out the other night planning on El Diablo and decided to try this cute little Italian restaurant. We are so glad we did! First off, the waiter was awesome, so friendly and on top of it.  He told us the history of the restaurant and gave us some good suggestions. The food was some of the best Italian food I have had in a long time. You can tell everything is made fresh.  The bread was delicious and a new recipe the owner received from his brother who lives in Sicily. We started off with the prosciutto wrapped Shrimp with a yummy sauce. I ordered the Penne Alla Vodka and my boyfriend ordered the traditional spaghetti and meatballs. The sauce in both dishes was excellent! The portions were a decent size with plenty of leftovers for my lunch the next day.  Finally, the cannoli was the best I have ever had! My boyfriend has been to Italy and said it was just as awesome as the ones he tasted there. I would highly recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for a delicious Italian meal for a good price.  The special he night we went was order two entrees and get any appetizer for free! Check this place out!
--------------------
The only good part.... 

Their stage is really cool! Raised up, lights that move around, good sound system, a fog machine, and a pretty big dance floor. 


But their food service.... crappy both times Ive been there. 

The last time I was there I walked in, hadn't been greeted by anyone at the empty front podium, and just found a table. I figured once I sat down Id wait for an employee to get back to the menus and go up and ask for one. So I saw a lady working up at the front and went up and asked her.  She said that they stopped serving food at...... I cant remember if it was 9 or 10 pm.... but she gave me a certain time that the kitchen closed. I went back to my table and looked at the time. It was 10 minutes before the time she told me the kitchen closed. I thought that was kinda dumb, but oh well.... maybe they stopped taking orders 10 minutes ahead or something. The next thing I see the SAME EXACT LADY seat four people RIGHT NEXT to our table and give them menus. Then she takes their order, and brings out their food. All I wanted were some freakin french fries and I had to sit there and watch the people who got there long after me eating french fries instead. RUDE!
--------------------
I do like this store. Its large and clean and they seem to have a large selection of everything. But I just returned from there and have the say the customer service is lacking. I took my french bulldog in to try on some sweaters. Just to be sure I asked if it was ok to actually try stuff on and they said yes. I began looking through the selection and trying stuff on. She is very hard to fit b/c she is short and stocky with a big head. So there I was 27 weeks pregnant with my dog, a purse and a carry cart trying to get her in and out of clothes. I was the only person in the store, while 4 people were behind the counter (and I was in plain view of them). At some point one of the cats in the store (free roaming) swatted my dog on the nose and she got away from me for a quick second. Still no one came to help. I imagine if I had asked for help someone would have appeased me but I don't think I should have had to ask in the first place. I left without buying any of the many things on my list. Very disappointed with today's visit. I expected better service and maybe that was my fault. I doubt I will be going back.
--------------------
This place treats you right from the moment you walk through the doors. I stay here every time I come to Reno, and the service seems to be getting better and better every time I return. On my last visit I stayed for free for 3 out of the 4 nights, and on top of that they gave me $120.00 of free play. The Peppermill is rated the casino with the loosest slots in casino. The rooms were clean,  the bathroom smelled great, and there weren't any bed bugs in our bed. The casino reminds me of old casino, when they relied on millions of lights bulbs, neon signs, and the smell of argon in the air. Happy hour everyday from 4-6 , you get mini apps and 3 dollar martinis at the fireside lounge. Also the Fish bar is awesome to go and relax, since they have a 40 foot aquarium that wraps around two of the walls. They have some excellent restaurants in the casino, that you don't even have to leave to satisfy any food craving you might have. The staff is extremely friendly and that is the top reason I keep coming back to this casino in Reno.
The only thing about this place is that the lights in the casino can really discombobulate you! Just remember that they key sleeve they give you has a map, so keep that in your pocket !
--------------------
We checked in around 2:30 pm.  Check-in was quick and easy with complimentary valet parking (always appreciated).  The Peppermill is huge and reminded us of the Caesars Palace in Las Vegas.  They have around eight restaurants on site offering almost any type of food you could want.  The casino area is huge, rivaling almost anything you could find in Las Vegas.  One thing we noticed is that many of the slot machines were noted as being penny machines, but when you actually started to play them you realized they had minimum bets of anywhere from 30 cents to $5.  Talk about false advertising!  We were in the Tuscany Tower on the 12th floor.  Our room had a nice view of the huge pool area.  Our room was large and featured free WiFi (likewise always appreciated), a huge bathroom area with large shower (with two shower heads), TV, a large jetted bathtub and a phone next to the commode.  There were dual sinks and lots of counter space.  Plenty of towels were supplied.  The roomy main area had a king bed with night stands, closet, TV, mini fridge, dresser with two drawers, a safe, table for computer or writing, complimentary bottles of water, and three nicely upholstered chairs and table.  The thermostat did a good job controlling the temperature and keeping it comfortable.  Staff were all courteous and helpful.  A very nice place and we enjoyed our stay.

Super lunch option
Watch out for the yoga mats
You won't miss the meat

Lunch has been very strange for me since HipCity opened. Because here's the thing: I am a meat eater. I mean like my last meal on earth would be a burger. Or, just maybe, the fajita wrap. Because it's that good.

Haven't had everything on the menu yet, but everything I have had has been great. The buffalo bella and crispy hipcity ranch are amazing sandwich alternatives, especially paired with the green lemonade. The groothie is also delicious, and can stand on its own to get you through an afternoon if you only want to spend a few bucks.

Okay suffice it to say that the food is great. The staff is also very friendly, and when they get busy someone will come out along the line and take orders so congestion doesn't get too bad at the register itself.

My only issue with HipCity is that it is at times nearly impossible to figure out where to stand when you're waiting to order or waiting for your food. People kind of convene everywhere and it can get awkward when there's a line out the door. In such a small space it's hard to rectify, but if I see a line out the door I tend to walk on by not because it's a long wait (they're really efficient), it's just difficult to navigate the interior.
--------------------
To the other reviewers 
You are reviewing the god damn stadium, not that your a Philly fan, and OMG your team won the world series in 08. 

-The food sucks, they do not have enough vendors, So if your enjoying the game, you pretty much have to get up to buy yourself a pretzel or soda. 
-Point out the worst food, the "Hoagies" or whatever are Terrible. Aren't they suppose to be like really good (Believe I'm in Philly). The french fries are mad greasy and no crunch or anything. They were soggy, greasy fries!!!! 
- They have cheap small TVs, that are blurry as hell, so there goes the idea of watching the game while your on line waiting for your food. 
- I would love to understand how the game has just started (3rd inning), and I find empty beer containers everywhere.. 

This is not part of my judgement, but for other people to be aware and be careful 
Philly fans are the RUDEST and NASTIEST people. They are very drunk people, they get in your face, they will spill things on you. Even if your a girl, they have no respect. 

This stadium SUCKS, visit it, knock it off your list, see cheap home runs, since the stadium is built for hitters... 
but we advised...Bring your own food and beware of Philly fans. 
PS: There still are nasty even if you aren't a mets fan...they are just rude people.
--------------------
This is a really fun event for those who enjoy beer in all its forms. The drinks themselves were relatively cheap ($2-4 for a 4 oz. sample. Most were $2, some were $3, and very few were in the $4 range), however the food was really over priced ($6 for a small cup of fancy macaroni and cheese? really?). For the beer lover, however, there is a wide variety of tried and true along with the new kids on the block from local, national and international lines. Also, if you like what you tasted, you can buy it on site, with a Sobeys/Safeway liquor store right on site doing specials on the sampled brews. 

We went VIP for this event, however I don't think it's worth it. What you get: a glass mug instead of a plastic one, a beer and food class ($2 value) and a beer seminar ($2 value). If you do it all, or really value the glass mug, go for it! But for me, who just did the beer and food class, it wasn't worth it. 

My only complaint is for the venue, but for an event that size, you need the space. $16 for parking on top of your entry fee (though I guess most people would cab or Uber it there so you don't have to have a designated driver), and then you have to buy sample tickets on site. It gets quite expensive.

This place was definitely the best dining experience I had in NOLA during my week-long trip! My husband and I walked in without reservations during their Sunday Jazz Brunch. We waited about 40 minutes, but we had the music and ambience to keep us occupied. 

Despite the place being ridiculously busy, our server didn't rush us at all. He encouraged us to take our time browsing the menu and placing our orders- definitely one of the friendliest servers I've encountered. 

The food here was absolutely amazing! The complimentary bread and butter was very nice. My husband and I started off with the seafood gumbo, and it was delicious! Both of us had a sea bass entree and it was definitely the best fish I've ever had. The fish came with a side of green beans and this DELICIOUS sauce that could make anything taste great. We finished off with chocolate orange ice cream and creme brûlée for dessert. The next table over was raving about their bread pudding, so I'm guessing dessert is usually a hit all around at this place. 

The coolest bit about my experience here was that my husband and I got seated where Ronald Reagan sat on his two visits to Mr. B's (far left corner)- Reagan just so happened to visit on my birthday! 

Our bill came out to be $100+ but it was worth every penny. If I'm in NOLA again, I'm definitely revisiting Mr. B's.

Went here with a friend after having an incredible experience at Laurel and was hoping for more of the same at a slightly less bulgy pricepoint, and oh my, is it worth it...    ITV is the kind of place that i dream about, beautiful small room, dimly lit but you can see ( as opposed to some places) and you want to see everything.  Everything in the room is beautiful including a lot of the staff, (im trying to give you the full picture here).   First thing to hit the table (or bar in this case) was a three dollar beef fat biscuit that was the best thing ive eaten in this city all year.  I verbally communicated that message to Chef Nick Elmi who graced us with his presence in the dining room (just as before at Laurel).    We went on to eat many more things which i will try to name now... Stars were Foie with Apricot Miso, Pork Cheeks with some insanely good vegetables, trout pumpernickel soldiers and one of the best cocktails ive had in a damn long time, the ouroboros.   The are playing around with cold smoking things in there and on their BAR MENU!   Honestly, place is just terrific and i meant to write this review sooner but hey... better late than never.  Now that i think of it, im getting hungry... maybe ill head to East Passyunk for some of the best this city has to offer!
--------------------
Absolutely amazing!!! My girlfriend and I went on a Wednesday night for Restaurant week and didn't know what to expect but we were overly satisfied. We ordered blood orange margaritas and they were strong and delicious. For our appetizers we had meatballs and let me tell you they weren't your average meatballs. They were veal and beef meatballs that melted in your mouth. Our other appetizer was some sort of grilled cheese that was amazing as well. For our entree we had the fishermen stew that was full of flavor and well balanced. Initially I did not think I was going to like it but it was to die for. Every element of the stew had it's own flavor and it was properly cooked. My girlfriend ordered the steak that came with cauliflower puree and a vegetable medley that was delicious as well. This was the first time we had ever ordered our steak to be medium-well and ever since we've been hooked. The steak was so juicy, tender and seasoned so eloquently and the puree was seasoned beautifully as well. 
The service there was amazing!! I forget the waitors name but he was great with the menu. He helped us order and came back frequently to check on us. 
Overall I think BARRA is amazing. It's not expensive and it is very intimate.  If you are looking for good food and great service at a reasonable price, BARRA is the place to go!!!!
--------------------
Despite it's great reviews by other Yelpers, I was not that blown away by Nippon Tei. 

My roommate and I were craving sushi and were recommended to come here by Yelp and a friend so we decided to give it a shot. 

First off, they get bonus points for serving FREE edemame as an appetizer. I usually pay $4 to $5 for it at other sushi restaurants. The mango sake drink I have was alright, but not worth the price I paid for it. 

On to the main event...SUSHI! We had the philly roll, tempura roll, tuna roll, and california roll. They were all yummy, but I would have to say I have had better. Actually, out of the hand-full of sushi restaurants I have tried, this was the worst sushi I have tried, but I cannot say the sushi was bad by any means. Don't get me wrong, it was still tasty. 

The other big thing was that the rolls were actually falling apart. I have never had this happen. Therefore, I can say that the presentation and the ability to get the sushi from the plate to my mouth without falling apart did make me unhappy. 

I am willing to come back to Nippon Tei, but I have to say I already have my other favorites. The prices were average compared to other sushi bars, so that won't really help them out either when it comes to bringing me back. We will see!

Stayed here for a bachelorette party. This place got the job done. Unfortunately, all the hotels in Santa Barbara are pretty freaking pricey. A lot of the other hotels started at $400+ /night.  This ain't Vegas where you can get something pretty cushy for $250. This seemed like a decent option on the lower end. Our rooms were about $250 a night. A lot of the other hotels in the area were already booked for the weekend or required more than one night to book. 

Pros: 
-decently priced
-clean and cozy rooms
-charming exterior and grounds
-relatively comfortable beds
-bath and body works shampoo, body wash etc
-free water bottles and fruit waiting for you in the room

Cons:
-dated decor 
-toilet issues: The hook inside kept coming undone. I guess we decided not to get maintenance because we temporarily fixed it, but it kept coming undone so it wouldn't really flush. We were checking out that day, so we decided just to deal with it. 
- door was difficult to open without using a certain technique
-no hair dryer, so bring your own
-no complimentary breakfast
-a bit noisy in the morning, but I slept fine. I guess the window in the bathroom was open or something for some ventilation.

Overall, I still don't think I would've chosen to stay anywhere else in Santa Barbara, so BW Pepper Tree Inn was still a good choice based on the location of the bachelorette and price range.

My son and I went in for burgers after a long day's drive returning him to Nashville for the upcoming semester. We were in need of immediate sustenance after a long fast. What we found was a busy place that actually knew how to operate with a full house. Our need were quickly satisfied with courteous and reasonably priced service. 

Since we were just two, we were quickly seated. We started off with a couple Highland stouts. It was a nice drink and at a reasonable price. Before our entree, we shared a large garden salad. It was fresh and flavorful. The dressing was a bit on the heavy side for a vinaigrette. 

For entrees, I had the Black and Blue burger with fries. The burger was just incredible. It was perfectly cooked. The blue cheese was not overpowering. The bun was soft and fresh. The side of regular fries were crisp and lightly salted. Even better, they went perfectly with the homemade ketchup. I'm not a fan of ketchup, but theirs is very nice since they seem to avoid adding too much sweetness. My son had a basic burger with sweet potato fries. I tried the sweet potato fries and think they might be some of the best I've ever eaten. The burger looked as good as mine and my son concurred. 

The burger was well made and consumed within minutes. No words were spoken as we ate. Always a good sign. We shall return.
--------------------
Before I share the main issue, I want to share the reason I give any stars is because of our awesome server, LaToya. She was thoughtful and engaging! 

The black bean burger was dry. Sweet potato fries were good. 

Today while at lunch with a group of colleagues the most disturbing thing happened. I noticed the manager in a green sweater lingering around the entrance and then two cop cars with lights flashing pulled up and 3 officers rushed in walked to the table next to us that the manager was pointing to and one of the officer's proceeded to pull out their handcuffs and tell the guy delivering food to put food down at the table and hands behind his back. They escorted him near the front door and had him sit down for a moment before taking him outside in freeZing cold with no jacket where he stood for a few minutes while cops came in and out of restaurant. 

This entire thing was poorly handled, disturbing and unsettling not only to the customers but the other staff. They should have had the cops walk back away from where customers were and deal with it there. Then all the managers disappeared not available to talk to any of the customers let alone apologize or acknowledge people being unsettled. 

No one needs to know why the arrest happened but there needed to be more care for customers and staff in how it was handled. 

Not ok!!!
--------------------
I moved to Philadelphia from the midwest as a wide eyed 19 year old full of wonder. Yuengling lager was the first beer I've ever truly enjoyed and remains in my top five favorites of all time. Smooth, sweet, cheap, it's like me in a bottle. I love that the bottlecaps can be rusty, I like that the taste varies per batch, I even like its relatively low alcohol content. 

The tour was pretty great, the British tour woman was funny in a non canned way. She took a shine to my grandpa and was constantly begging him to sell her his hat (signed, sports, I haven't a clue). I was amazed at how close they let you get to the active equipment, I could've spit in the mash and no one would've been the wiser. The whole facility reminded me of St. Pete Catholic High, 50's cinderblock with a residue of toil clinging to the walls. 

The tasting, that's what you came for right? Fantastic. They were out of Lord Chesterfield, but who drinks that? I "tasted" the shit out of the lager, probably 6 times. It makes sense, the bar is next to the gift shop and I went a bit insane in there. 

The fact that Dick Yuengling made it a point to hire back the laid off workers after the last closure bumps it up a star. This is a family business, one that deserves support as Inbev has encroached upon everything else.
--------------------
My dad and I were here for lunch and after reading some of the reviews, I was excited to check out this restaurant located where an O'Henry's once stood.

The place was fairly empty at 1 on a Friday and we were lead upstairs. Honestly, there's not much going on up there and it was a bit warm, but we decided to stick it out. Everything on the menu looked great and I decided to get the Catfish Acadian, which is catfish topped with crawfish and sauce with a side of vegetables. My dad got the pork chop.

My dish was great! I have no idea what was in the sauce but it was delicious and it was a perfect pairing with the fish. The vegetables were also really good; they were nicely cooked and fresh. My dad wasn't overly blown away by his pork chop, so if you find yourself here you might want to stick to the seafood.

Bria was our waitress and she was wonderful! She was attentive, kept the fresh iced tea coming and she was extremely personable. She was probably the highlight of the visit.

I'm not sure if I would go back. The food was good, but the atmosphere left something to be desired and I feel like I can get good catfish at plenty of places without going out of my way. I might go back at dinner, when the weather is cooler, and sit on the balcony outside as Harry suggested.
--------------------
We arrived a few minutes early for a 7pm reservation. When we asked for our table, both hostesses looking at their paper, then said they'd have to go check and would be back. 5 minutes later, they returned and did not acknowledge us. Meanwhile, another large party arrived without a reservation and were told it would be a 40 minute wait. We then heard one hostess say to the other that she didn't want to seat them soon because the kitchen was backed up and people were waiting 40 minutes for their appetizers. So unprofessional.
We walked up again, after they continued to ignore us, and asked about our table. They weren't apologetic when they told us that the girl we spoke to earlier that day was new and never recorded our reservation. They continued to tell us that it would be at least a 20 minute wait before they could put our table together. We got a smug "I'm sorry, but she was new" and they brushed us off.
I really understand that sometimes things just don't go the way they were supposed to and that people make mistakes. However, a little customer service would have gone a long way. Offer us some water, or a seat at the bar or say that you're doing everything you can to get us in as soon as possible. They basically blew us off and blamed it on the new girl. 
Needless to say we left and I will not be returning.

Just got 2 tattoos at Stigma today and I am so happy! I went there because they have good reviews and their website is good. I got a cluster or roses on my shoulder with some "brush strokes" of color on them. My tattoo artist is Eddie. He is very friendly and fun! He did exactly like I asked. He is a very good artist. His line work is perfect and so I will be going back to him for more. I have a bad back (bulging and hemorrhaged discs) and sometimes I can't sit in the same place for long periods of time. Eddie was very helpful and accommodating with that. While I was there I talked to pretty much every employee there. The entire staff are really friendly. It's a cool place to be. I did a Yelp check-in and got $10 off! How cool is that?! On the website I saw that the owner, Chino developed his own tattoo ointment. He said that he just wasn't very happy with the other stuff that's out there because they are petroleum product so he did a ton of research and developed his own. It has ingredients like sunflower and soybean oil, lavender, beeswax, vitamin E, Shea and cocoa butter. I bought some and it is indeed very soothing. If you are looking to get inked, go here. You will be in good hands with some great artists and you will be just as happy as I am right now.

My husband son and I went in for dinner last Friday night. Upon entering we were greeted by a friendly hostess. As we stood there waiting for her to grab the menus I couldn't help but to notice a strong dirty mop water stench. Thankfully when we left the entry way it didn't carry into the dining room. The remodel is impressive looking. We were sat at a booth. Looking over the menu I was surprised at how limited it was. As long as you make what you offer well no biggie. I ordered the mushroom swiss burger and a beer. My husband ordered the "knuckle sandwich", ( tri-tip sandwich served French dip style). My son ordered the chicken strips and we all got French fries as our side. Jesse, our server was nice enough but in the loud dining room you couldn't hear a word he said. I was more annoyed that he didn't take the initiative to speak up than about the noise. The beer came out, although tasty it wasn't cold enough at all. The food came out within a reasonable amount of time. My husband's "Knuckle Sandwich" was delicious! That is what the two stars are for. My burger was shockingly small and probably the blandest burger I have ever eaten. My son's chicken strips tasted like they floured them...and that was it... also, no hint of seasoning. The fries are your run of the mill freezer to fryer. I hope they step it up and are successful.
--------------------
I'm rating this based on the service and not the food. I am a sales administrator at a hotel. Typically, many places offer a hospitality discount because we do refer guests different places. Front desk told me I should try this place as they give a decent discount. I called to place my order and wasn't really able to say what I liked b/c the girl who answered would cut me off to finish my statement.(she wasn't in the best mood) We get to the end of the order and she asks me am I a guest or an employee. I told her an employee. She asked my title. I told her. She gives me a total and I asked her about the discount. She says it's only for front desk. I'm shocked that this is a departmental thing 1 and 2 I'm thinking to myself, "I'm in sales. I get groups of people here. They ALWAYS asked for recommendations." I said well should I hang up and have front desk place my order? She huffed and puffed and then said "well i'll give it to you this time but please dont abuse it." I was so shocked at how rude she was. So when I finally got my food, I tipped the driver and gave him their menus back and said we will no longer be doing business with you guys. She didnt know SALES is in charge of who the front desk can recommend. Her name was Neisha.The food was good though.
--------------------
Thank you for a lovely morning!  I was in NJ early and decided to stop in for a delicious diner breakfast.  I got a taylor ham, egg, and cheese and a short stack of blueberry pancakes (I simply couldn't decide between sweet or savory, plus leftovers are never a bad thing).  

The egg sandwich was fantastic.  I was nervous when they said they didn't have kaiser rolls so I went with a hamburger roll.  It was an excellent decision.  The roll was excellent - not just an average cheap hamburger roll.  They layered the cheese on the sandwich, which to me is a must for a true egg sandwich.  It was served with home fries, which were sauteed with large slices of peppers and onions.  I'm not the biggest breakfast potatoes fan, but these were great and I appreciated that they didn't clearly just scoop some food from a huge pile of pre-cooked home fries.

The pancakes were great and fluffy.  My one gripe was their use of smuckers pre-packaged syrup.  I realize that if they put syrup in a container, it probably wouldn't be real maple syrup, but I sort of wish I didn't know that they were giving me sub-par syrup.

The server was friendly and very attentive.  The coffee refills were constant, and the coffee was actually good (so many diners fail at coffee).  Bonus points for the server agreeing not to judge my decision to get two breakfasts.

All around, I loved this place and hope to go back soon.  Long live the Jersey diners!
--------------------
After hearing about this place from a fellow Yelp Elite, my SO and I decided to try this place! We were warned of possible waiting times so came here on a Saturday around 10:45, and a line was already forming! 

For apps, we ordered the takoyaki and fried octopus. The takoyaki are delicious-an order comes with 5 balls that were perfectly cooked and topped with sauces. Takoyaki are little circular doughs with squid in the middle, topped with sauces and squid flakes (?). I definitely recommend this app. As for the fried octopus, it was just fried without sauces on top and came with mayo on the side, but it didn't come with enough mayo to dip the octopus in.

For ramen, I got the red spicy tonkotsu ramen and my SO got the black garlic tonkotsu ramen. For both ramen, the thin noodles were mushy/overcooked and just didn't quite fit with the ramen. That was the flaw with the dishes, and it tasted like the noodles were overcooked in a pot of flour-y water so it wasn't as clean (which explains the mushy feeling). They should use more bouncy noodles for this.

Now let's talk about the broth. The broth is flavorful, but the red chili broth was a bit too spicy for me and covered up the depth of the broth. I prefer the black garlic tonkotsu broth for that reason.

Overall, delicious food and pricing is reasonable. The decor is very nice as well, but screaming kids that were running around didn't make our meal pleasant.
--------------------
I feel so comfortable with the Mazzoni Center.  I, and many others, am incredibly lucky and grateful that these services exist.  Going through all sorts of life challenges can be painful and frightening when you know you're assumed to be a certain way.  Here, there are no assumptions.  They know who they're working with, and they are sensitive without the need to pry for information.  If you're in need of gynecology and you're not a woman, for example, they know exactly how to handle your needs while prioritizing respect for your identity.

My biggest concern is the physical space in which the Mazzoni Center clinic exists.  I feel sort of exposed in the waiting room.  I hope that they someday have the funds to upgrade to a larger, more private space.

If you visit during youth drop-in hours rather than making an appointment, you will probably wait a very long time to see someone.  This is completely understandable, in my opinion.  They'll advise you regarding what time you should show up if you call.

Occasionally, I've noticed lapses in communication; I have been kept waiting in the exam room before with no one around and no idea how much longer I would have to wait.  This is not a common issue, and I find that, overall, I receive more attentive service here than at any other clinic I've visited.

Be aware that the doctor you want to speak with may not always be available over the phone.  Don't be afraid to leave messages with reception.  You'll always receive quick assistance.

Came there again because of yelp reviews!
Just want to tell you the way the salon looks like already giving you feeling that they know what are they doing! Very clean, simple, professional. Two ladies met me at the front room, ask me about my preferences, tell me about the packages and prices they have - very understandable.  They put some information about me in the computer and i am all set for waxing!  They goes by appointments - always!! 
I did my armpits - to give it a try) My specialist were Despina!  Really really nice lady i've been pleased talking to her while she was easy with no pain taking off the hair which were really hard cause for 3-4 month i used shaving and the hair got really thick! Still it wasn't so painful cause she used the hard wax which i Loved immediately! Great job - very clean - fast and easy! And price was just 16$ which were really good deal for this quality of waxing! 
She asked me when i would like to come back for armpits an we scheduled apointment in 3 weeks! But I might go earlier for bikini! I believe it wouldn't be so painful like it was before! So i will go for it! 
As well i bought there a treat for ingrown hair!  We will see how it works)
Thank you Very much for great service! And great atmosphere! You can trust them!
***** little addition********
Did a bikini today!  Never was painless than today! ! Next time I will do full bikini! 
Again thank you Despina!

Not mediocre at all IMHO.  Makes me wonder if Daniel O. went to the same place we did.

This is a great neighborhood byob place that provides welcoming service and excellent food at a reasonable price.  We started going here because numerous South Philly friends recommended it.  This is not foo-foo Italian.  This is not pretentious Italian.  This is "let's go back and work our way through the menu" Italian.  We found the specials to be good choices.  My husband's broccoli rabe and sausage was excellent, as was a grilled romaine salad with bleu cheese and pine nuts.  Both were generous enough to share.  Last time, sausage & figs was a hit.  If you are in the mood for a basic plate of macaronis with red gravy, you won't be disappointed either.  We had a great time with the waitress because my BIL brought a bottle of Great Wall wine from China (that was the 2nd bottle we opened) and that started a whole crazy discussion.  She didn't know us from Adam, but we left there feeling like regulars.

It's a very doable destination if you are on your way to a sporting event at the Linc or the Cit, or to the Spectrum or Wachovia Center.  For those who rely on public transportation, you can get off the subway at Broad & Oregon, then walk back a block to Broad & Porter.  Make a reservation, though because it can be a popular place.  You also want to make sure you have time to have a relaxing meal and make your event in time.
--------------------
We've been going to the Rib Cook-Off for a few years now, but apparently I've never taken the time to review it. We have our day pretty much planned out before heading down there. 

We walk to the bus stop by our house, the bus takes us directly to the Sparks bus station for a whopping $2 each. No parking, no driving through crowds, and no paying for parking. Winning.

From the bus station, we head immediately to Great Basin to get a large Icky and Bitchin' Berry. Beer is a must for battling these crowds and the large beers are worth the price!

If you have the JA Nugget mobile app, it will tell you where every vendor is and show it on a map. No more mindless wandering looking for your favorite vendor. I don't have a favorite, but go off of recommendations from friends, co-workers, etc.

Some vendors take cards, but we always make sure to bring plenty of cash. 

Be sure to walk through the non-rib vendors too. We got a couple of hats this year, which are nice to have at the event, but are also great beach hats for next year.

Saturday was a whole day affair and required us taking a cab back home. But because there was practically no crowd on Monday, we were able to get a beer, some food, and still use our bus transfer to get back home. Food stops being served at 5:00 pm on Monday and the vendors also start selling off extra food at crazy cheap prices.
--------------------
I came here because of the higher rating and they accepted my insurance. My initial visit went well, no complaints on the staff or the doctor at that time. 

They switched my brand from Acuvue to Air Optix and about 2 weeks after using the contact I started to experience pain, redness and irritation. I took my contacts out that evening and had red rings around both of my eyes. I tried contacting them via telephone and left a message as well as email, I failed to hear back from them in a timely manner so I reached out to them again and got ahold of them. I simply wanted my contacts switched back to Acuvue and they tried to tell me that it was allergies causing my problems and were insisiting on me keeping Air Optix. Eventually I did get them to agree to switch my contacts back to acuvue. 

In march I had another eye irritation and I went to Vanderbilt Eye Institue, they told me it was a continued reaction to the Air Optix lenses because I did not give my eyes enough time to heal before applying my new contacts - which was I was not educated on by Music City Optical when I got my new set of contacts. I then reviewed them on facebook at that time. 

Today (8/30/16) I recieved a response to my review on facebook and a corresponding email stating that I was being slanderous and lying, which was not the case at all. I was simply explaining my experience with Music City Optical.

Went to see Star Wars Rogue One yesterday in 3D.  Buying the tickets was a breeze, and the atmosphere was inviting.  Found the comfortable seats with no problem and ordered right away before the movie began.  I ordered pretzel sticks - food was hot, prompt & delicious.  I was excited for the movie to begin.  Once the advertisements were done and the movie started, that's when I noticed something wasn't right.  The entire screen was so dark that I was not able to make out the faces of the actors on the screen.  I kept lifting up the 3D glasses to see if it made a difference - nope.  The two people seated next to me were noticing the same and complaining.  I thought that maybe this is how the movie was filmed?  Then it got worse.  Even with the 3D glasses on, the shadows in the background on the screen were double and there was no discerning most actors' faces at all.  I got up and went to the lobby and asked for the manager.  The gentleman wore a blue shirt, middle age with a beard, said that this was the 3D experience, it was a "closed-system" and there was nothing he could do.  I simply asked him to come with me into the theater to see with his own eyes how dark it was.  He would not and did not.  I suspect this wasn't the first time he's heard this from a customer.  I've seen normal movies at this location before, but this was my first, and last experience with their 3D in room #1.
--------------------
It saddens me to say this but I think I need a new nail salon. I have consistently come here for a few years now and the service has never been as bad as it has been the last few times I've been here. Here are my issues:

1) the girl at the front desk never once looked up from her papers while "greeting" me and asking me what I want. She mumbled under her breath to go pick out a color then yelled across the salon that I was getting a mani and pedi. 
2) once I picked out my color I went back to the front and someone who came in after me was seated in a pedi chair, water turned on etc. to get service. Once she saw that I was standing in the front she got a chair going for me. The problem with that is there were no more nail technicians available to work on me.
3) so now I'm sitting in cold water waiting for someone to come and do my feet. 
4) the pedicure started, she painstakingly dug into my toes (which I absolutely hate) and rushed through the Massage part of the pedi
5) after it was all said and done, I find out that their prices have gone up! 

I used to come here because they have later hours and are open on Sunday's but after a 3rd terrible experience here I am not coming back. In the last 3 months, almost the whole staff has changed and these folks are not meeting my needs.
--------------------
Very unhappy, you lost a valued customer. We had a problem where Monro Muffler underfilled our engine by 3 quarts of oil and caused damage to the engine. Monro's insurance company said they would pay for damages if we brought to the dealer, we were frequent customers of Bergeys so we brought it here. They discovered the timing chain needed to be replaced, a chain that lasts the life of the car unless you don't change the oil or have low oil pressure the tensioner can lock and stretch the chain. Joe the service associate that took the car in specifically said I told the insurance company as little as possible and told them he couldn't tell if it was from the oil and there was no way to tell. And on top of that, was extremely rude and unprofessional to my wife bringing her to tears the way he spoke to her. My wife and I just bought a house in the area, only 26 years old and you lost a life long customer. Over the past year we spent about $7000 in repairs here, and Joe went out of his way to be unhelpful and leave us in a terrible spot. I brought it to another mechanic who was able to help us prove more it was from the oil and do what Joe told us and the insurance company they could not do. So on top of losing a service customer, I'm on the market for a new car and can tell you for sure where I will not be getting it.
--------------------
I brought my boyfriend here on a Saturday for a tour and beer sampling since Yuengling is one of his favorite beers. We never knew it was so close!

Be sure to look on their website for tour times before going and read the FAQ's. 
- First note: There were many people wearing flip flops on our tours vs. the insisted closed toe shoe policy, but that could be because of the next note.
- Second note: There is no production/brewing on Saturdays so the brewery is quiet and empty.

We looked around the main waiting/lobby area and gift shop waiting for our 12p tour to begin.  We had quite a large group, which had to split into two smaller ones. The tour lasted about 40 minutes, starting with a ten minute video of the history of Yuengling and the rise to present day. Next, the guide takes you out to the brewery, and into the kettle room, around through the lab, the bottle line, and the holding tanks. The tour was informative and hands on. Our guide was informative and knew quite a lot about the history and brewing process. She did a great job!

Once done, you loop back into the lobby where the tasting room is and it's drinks galore. The BEST PART? FREE. Tips are encouraged! ;)
We tried the Premium Lager, Lager, and Black and Tan. Sadly they were out of the Lord Chesterfield this day and the Premium Light is not available here in FL.

Overall, a great tour and I will be revisitng with my parents when they are in town!
--------------------
I really enjoy this little restaurant full of goodness. Primarily a dessert place, Seasons also serves up some wonderful food dishes which are largely modernized updates on traditional classics. 

I always enjoy the shaved ice when I come here. The kind Seasons offers is a different type of dessert that I haven't seen anywhere else. The variety of boba tea that they have is also very 
good. Among my favorite shaved ice are the hula and the koko loco. If you want half and half flavors of shaved ice in your cup there is an additional $1.50 charge for a large size. There are pre-designed concoctions or you could create your own configurations of toppings and flavors. The pre designed concoctions are a better deal.

Seasons is situated on the end of a strip mall (across from a large shopping plaza with Regal Cinemas and Marshalls) with plenty of parking. The store itself is clean, bright, and modern and is kid-friendly as there are high hairs available for use. 

The service has always been friendly, fast, and efficient. Seasons employs an order at the counter, take number, and food is borough out to you when ready model. 

I can't comment on the food exactly but my boyfriend loves the quail and our friends enjoy the chicken wings which Boon touts as "the best food item" there. The quail is small and very flavorful and the wings are a good size and seasoned with five spice which was enjoyed by all. 

I look forward to many more visits with friends at this location. Check Seasons out and enjoy!

I LOVE Weaver's Way and really disagree with some of the content in previous reviews. WW is not necessarily meant for convenience shopping. I am a single woman and I find that I have no trouble shopping at the co-op, during peak times or otherwise. I actually find the co-op to be a great place to shop if you live alone because I can get smaller quantities of items than if I shop at the corporate stores like Acme. I also enjoy the work hours - I've worked throughout the store, but most recently, I have been getting in my hours by participating in the membership committee. I wouldn't say that the community is necessarily made up of "tree huggers" and "earth children", though. The community is made up of a variety of similarly-minded folks from different backgrounds. I enjoy having a place to go to where I can obtain locally grown produce, a place that offers more natural, wholesome, and preservative-free foods than chain stores with prices way below that of Whole Foods. I enjoy interacting with other members and contributing to my local and global community. I don't find the membership fee or the work hours to be prohibitive being a single person vs. a family. I don't think that membership in a co-op is for everyone and, if you aren't single, it's definitely not a solo decision. If you're keen on being committed to the Weaver Way values, you couldn't find a better place to shop. If not, stick to the chain stores or just pay the 10% visitors' fee to pop in once in a while.

This was a tough one!   On the merits of the wine, fairly average... I understand that the winery has more than one lable and other label is their premium wines.  I look forward to when that is available (I went two weeks ago so maybe it already is)     Location..   what's not to like?  On the pier!  A wonderful outdoor patio,  couldn't have a nicer setting to enjoy your tasting....   The staff were super, super nice,  I would give them an A+!  

So why only three stars?  It is because of the wine club!  Very expensive for the quality of the wines and stingy as HELL with the benefits to the members..   Most wine clubs will give you a free tasting every time you come in (after all, we are your best customers... we are the ones who buy your wine time and time again).  Some wineries will give their members a complimentary glass in leau of a tasting (Carr).   Most wineries allow you to bring guests which is how you get new wine club members.   This system works folks!  The way this wine club works is that you are given a very limited number of passes per quarter, five as I recall.   If I come with my wife once a month we wouldn't even be covered... let alone if we bring a guest!   

So go to this winery if you want to enjoy a tasting in one of the most beautiful settings on earth.   But avoid the wine club!  For that you can pretty much go to any of the other wine tasting rooms on the Urban wine trail.
--------------------
I came in here the other night for a  post-show snack after seeing a ESO performance at the Winspear. The main reason we chose this location was because it was close to the Winspear, and open late (until 11:30pm on Friday and Saturday). I don't have any strong criticisms of the restaurant. I suppose, if anything, the menu may have seemed a little bit over-priced - at least for what I ordered. I had a Caesar salad with three 'jumbo' shrimp on it, which cost $15. The portion size did not seem to justify the cost and the jumbo shrimp were fairly average in their size, but the flavours were good and the ingredients were fresh. My friend had a soup, which looked and smelled absolutely amazing, and at $6 it didn't seem too unreasonable. She also had the smoked salmon Carpaccio, which looked very appetizing with its thick slices of dark rye bread and generous slices of smoked salmon and capers. The also had a couple of interesting beers on their menu that we were keen to try.

I think if you're going to a show in the area and looking for a spot to get a drink or a snack afterward, this is not a bad option. Their menu at that time of night had an interesting mix of appetizers and desserts that seemed to provide something to suit most tastes.

I'm assuming Normand's Bistro must be connected to the Normand's restaurant which is on Jasper Avenue. Of interest, I have heard that Normand's took over the brunch menu that had formerly been offered at the Glenora Bistro.
--------------------
Came here for Sunday brunch and walked away with a very full belly and a good buzz! 

Their brunch buffet includes tons of seafood, an omelet station, pasta bar, carving station, custom sushi rolls, fresh fruit, salads, and the usually breakfast foods you'd expect at a buffet. I almost forgot dessert...an entire side of the room is dedicated to a table full of desserts AND a chocolate fountain. The brunch price also include bottomless mimosas which were literally bottomless. Our server never let us empty our glasses and  the mimosas were very heavy on the champagne, so we all got a bit tipsy. At least the alcohol let us forget how much weight we gained during this meal.

As if the buffet spread wasn't enough, they also have an a la carte menu with small dishes. The choices included Belgian waffles, french toast, blintzes, Mahi, and a few other savory dishes.  You can order as many of these items as you want, as many times as you want. Our server was sure to remind us of this, she seemed to enjoy watching how gluttonous our table was! 

Unfortunately we were here during Tropical Storm Debby, so we didn't get to enjoy a beautiful view of the bay, Although, being here while the weather was so awful was very cozy with the fireplace and wood interior. Thanks to the weather it wasn't crowded either, so don't write this place off on account of bad weather. 

At $35 a person, the Sunday brunch seems pricey, but if you have no qualms about overeating and overdrinking, you'll definitely get your money's worth.
--------------------
My friend and I visited Tampa for a concert, and about ten minutes away from the Atlanta airport he realized that he had purchased tickets for the wrong day. We had already made hotel reservations and bought the concert tickets, so he just had to pay same-day price for airfare: all in all about $800 more. "It was totally worth it," he later told me, "Because I got to have the best sandwich of my entire life."

All because we randomly picked the Bricks of Ybor from Yelp. I can't vouch for the peanut butter or meatless menu, but the meat sandwiches that we bought were absolutely phenomenal. I had the pulled pork, which was flavored with ponzu and served on Hawaiian sweet bread. It was one of the best meals I've had in a long time. We spent a few hours hanging out and drinking, during which time Brian, the owner, came out and talked to us, comped us a drink, let us try new appetizers he was developing (all for free) and generally made us feel really welcome. 

I kept my eyes open to the kind of crowd that came in and out of the restaurant. It seemed to draw everything from hipsters to geriatrics and strait-laced families with young kids. I think it speaks to both the diversity of the menu and the pleasant environment. We went back for drinks before and after the concert. It got very crowded but we still received excellent food, drinks and service. I give this restaurant my strongest recommendation, and it's the first place I'm going when I next visit Tampa.
--------------------
I had the worst experience of my life and it's not over yet.  I made a mistake in purchasing a vehicle that is out of my budget on a Friday afternoon.  By Sunday after review of my budget I realized I was unable to afford the car.  I called the salesman and tried to explain my situation at 11:30am.  He stated he would speak with his manager and call me back.  At 3:30 after no return call, I called him again, no answer. I left a voicemail and still no call at closing time.  Monday morning I arrived at the dealership as they were opening.  I asked Stephen, the salesman what they determined.  He instructed me to have a seat and he would talk to his management team.  One hour + later, I was called into a cubicle and told my loan had been funded and the title had been changed.  Therefore, I would have to sell the car back to the dealership as a used car.  I would lose a lot of money in doing this.  This morning, Bill head of finance advised that the bank had questions about funding the loan.  I received a call from the bank stating the loan had NOT been funded and they would be unable to okay the loan.  I have left numerous messages with the dealership and have yet to receive a callback.  I contacted an attorney and per his review I again called the dealership and asked for a time to return the vehicle and take back my trade.  Still no response!  These people will lie to your face, avoid this dealership!!
--------------------
Husband and I made a mistake and came here on a Lenten Friday. The wait was forever. But since we were already there, might as well suck it up and see what's it all about. We ordered the blackened alligator and oysters for appetizers, the alligator came out within 15 minutes, and it was alright. A bit too greasy. Then another 15 minutes later, our raw oysters came out, I wanted mine char grilled but the waitress didn't mention they don't have char grilled oysters and still took my order, so I thought I was waiting for mine to be cooked the entire time. When she brought out the two half-dozen raw oyster trays, that's when she told me they only have raw oysters there. SMH. I have sensitive stomach so I only had 3 then gave the rest to my husband. Regardless, the oysters were really fresh. We waited for at least another 20 minutes later for our entrees to come out. At this point, I was really hungry and had hoped we were at home eating ramen noodles instead. My husband had the roast beef po-boy, and I had the tuna and shrimp kabob. My husband told me his roast beef was really salty and while ironically, my kabob was very bland. The kabob came with exactly 3 pieces of cubed tuna, 2 medium size shrimp with plenty of bell peppers and onions in between, and baby shrimp creole with rice. For the ok price, I shouldn't complain too much about this place. Didn't try their seafood boil, but it looked like that would have been a better choice.
--------------------
After living in the STL area for way over 10 years now, I am both ashamed and remorseful to admit that I ate here for the FIRST time just a few weeks ago. I am ashamed because it's a St. Louis tradition and remorseful because I missed out on it for so..many...years! 

This place is amazing. What is not to love! It's a factory where you can get a tour (Friday-Sunday, noon-5pm on the hour), there's a shop, bar, and dining area. They also host many event with live music on the weekends. It's fun to just kind of wander and look around - don't worry, you'll get a chance because there will likely be a wait before you dine. The beer is, of course, amazing. The Hefeweizen is my personal favorite and a great start for anyone who is not a huge beer drinker (like myself). Additionally, the food is homegrown and damn good. I had the pizza (recommendation from my server) and it was really spectacular, though I'm admittedly a pizza connoisseur so I enjoy a good pizza pie more than most probably ;P My date had a bison burger which was also really good. 

More fun info: the service is great! I think they tend to hire more funky and alternative people (like tattoo parlor staff) which I support. The quality is what makes this place stand out along with the emphasis on local food and brewery. 

It is a little on the pricier side but for all the experience you get and the quality, it is worth it. I will go again and again and you probably should, too!
--------------------
I would recommend Twisted Twig to everyone - excellent service, very friendly, and create amazing arrangements!

You will not regret working with Jen! I reached out to a few different florist 2 weeks before my wedding. I was frantic my wedding was only 2 weeks away and didn't have a florist, even though it was a small wedding. I got a hold of Jen, who I might say was very responsive.

I got on the phone with Jen and she was so nice and very genuine. We spoke about what I was looking for and I texted her some pictures of inspiration and my dress. She asked me if there were certain flowers I was looking for and my budget. I didn't have any flowers in mind, as long as the colors are what I wanted and told her my budget. She sent me a quote, staying within my budget, noting the flowers she would use for the bouquet, boutonniere, and floral arrangements for the arch I had. It was nice that Jen works with you to stay in your budget yet still get what you want.

On the wedding day, Jen arrived at my hotel door right on time with my beautiful bouquet. The floral arrangements at the site was gorgeous also. Jen really hit the mark on what I wanted for my wedding. She also was very sweet and added some roses on the chairs by the aisle to my surprise, which was not on the quote. That was very special because it pulled the whole ceremony look together and I felt Jen really wanted everything to look perfect for me.

I don't think they have enough staffs here. Always you can see customers waiting. It took them about an hour and more to have my car ready. Even worse, in the next morning before I was gonna take my family out for a trip, I found my car had no wiper fluid; hence I had no choice but went back and waste another hour waiting them to refill it.

The car was not thorough cleaned (either outside or inside). I rent the car on May 18th, extremely close to my 25th birthday (June 6th), and still, I was still charged for underage fee, which is extremely expensive -- $20 BEFORE TAX PER DAY. There was just no way to waive it. I should have gone for, and I will recommend others in the future to find another rental company such as Hertz, at which you can always find codes to waive this crazy fee.

The last thing is DO NOT buy the fuel option. Although it claims $1.99 per gallon, this is before tax. You will find the price after tax to be very closed to what you can find outside. And, you will NEVER return the car on empty. This is nothing good but a trick for rental companies to steal 3- to 4-gallon sales from you.


*** Final note:
Not about this location but where I returned my car.

"Return Location Address and Phone Number :
PORT JEFFERSON STATION
320 ROUTE 112
PORT JEFFERSON STATION, NY 11776-1010
Tel.: (631) 474-2100"

This address is totally WRONG!!! I kept asking people around this address for the right location and wasted another hour when returning my car!
--------------------
Went here before a show we were seeing in the University City area.  It is just across the street from 30th Street Station, and just down the street from Drexel University.  We we able to get street parking about 2 blocks down the street, so that is always a plus.  

Service was sufficient for dinner.  We tried the mac and cheese appetizer that had just the right amount of breadcrumbs on it.  It was served hot, but with average taste.  We also tried the cheeseteak egg rolls - decent, but not a lot of meat in them.  Some of the bites I had of the egg roll were merely the fried dough without getting to any of the cheese and meat.   They were served with ketchup and a special mustard that had some horseradish in it for a bit of a kick!  I must say, it is a neat thing for a Philadelphia Pub to have on a menu.  

For our main entrees, we both had the chicken pot pie.  The vegetables were plentiful, and the chicken was all white meat, though there was not that much of it.  The crust was somewhat flaky, but there was a section of my pot pie crust that didn't seem like it was cooked all the way through.  

Dessert portion sizes were huge!  We had the bread pudding which was average in taste, and served with a scoop of vanilla ice cream.  The brownie was served ala mode with vanilla ice cream as well.  The brownie was definitely dry and lacking in taste, though I consider myself to be a brownie snob, so maybe I'm being overly picky.
--------------------
A great spot to take out-of-town guests. I take all my Chicago friends here and they fall in love. The burgers are incredible and the boozy shakes are like no other. The first time I had horchata shake I honestly had dreams about it for like a week. It's also super centrally located, a quick walk from Wash Ave and other downtown attractions. Great vibe, although I always prefer to get a table upstairs than sit at the community tables on the ground floor.

The burger selection is really, really great. You can pretty much get whatever your heart desires. I've had mac n cheese patties on my burger, you can get a bison burger, turkey burger, literally anything. I have tried a ton and have never been let down by the flavor combinations. The waiters are always super honest, in a good way. If you ask them what's better, X or Y, they're not going to jerk you around and say they're equally good. They'll give you their honest opinion. LOVE that. 

Another unique aspect about Bailey's Range is that they have a burger showdown (can't remember their technical term for it) where last week's featured burger goes up against a new burger recipe. It's a cool call-out that you don't see at a lot of other restaurants. 

The only reason I gave it a 4/5 star instead of 5/5 is because I've had a couple of instances (out of MANY visits, so it's really not alarming or anything) where I requested my burger medium or medium-rare and it turned out a little well done. I still ate it, but it wasn't really what I expected.
--------------------
A really nice place to get your hair did with as much of an edge as you want.  

In the East Loop, across from the Pageant, might be one of the most underrated salons in the city.  I first went into this place as a walk-in, and keep on going back.  Yes, I'm a guy, and since my hair is pretty coarse, grows weird, and I want a bit of style to it, I go to hair salons.  At V Vegaz I've never been dissatisfied with my cut. 

When you walk in you realize how spacious the place is, with a bit of a slightly modern, slightly baroque interior design.  There's a nice vibe there too amongst the employees, and you can see that the stylists are happy with the work situation.  Of course, happy stylists, to me, mean better haircuts.

I go to Callie, since that first walk-in, and keep on going back.  Yes, she's real friendly, which is a nice touch, but she's also a great stylist.  I'm a bit wishy washy when I look for a cut, usually changing what I want most of the time.  Callie's sensitive to that, and really understands how my hair grows and where it's going to move.   I think the biggest compliment to her is that, as I'm a once a month haircut kinda guy, my brother and sister told me they really my hair a full month after I had it cut with Callie.  So that's really a testament to her skills.

I've not gotten color there, but it is a full service salon, and not just a turn and burn place.  

I highly recommend this place.
--------------------
As much as I adore food I am, typically, pretty easy when it comes to food and I forgive a lot. SO...one star means a lot! I haven't been as livid as I was leaving this fiasco of a restaurant in a long while. Reasons:  The server was on her cell phone from the minute we walked in to the minute we walked out (about 90 minutes). She literally had it on her shoulder the entire time except to say, "Please hold" to take our orders. She was also the chef and cooked while talking on her bloody phone, as well. Service:  FAIL.
My pork leg was tender and good which constitutes the lonely little star you see above. My husband ordered the shrimp, which cost $18.99. He received 7 shrimp that would be in a bag of 31-35 count...the size worthy of a salad shrimp. Again, $18.99...and the plantain portion of the meal consisted of 2 plantains the width of a postage stamp. Ridiculous. I then ordered tostones because I knew he would never be full with that quantity of food. I had to get up and find our server to add to my order as she was nowhere to be found.  They were also ridiculously thin, were over salted with an almost breaded and deep fried consistency. Food:  FAIL.
I was going to order a Cuban coffee but the server was so non-existent that I just gave up, finally.  In retrospect, I'm happy I didn't order it because I'm sure it would have been just wrong.
I would not frequent this restaurant again even if I had a free coupon. Don't waste your time or energy.
--------------------
What a disappointment. This place was not good I would suggest you think twice before selecting this option. The manager and wait staff may possibly be the worst I have ever encountered, rude and definitely not focused on customer service.  The manager is a very angry hostile fella I asked if I could get brown rice instead of white and he blasted me...I offered to pay extra and he stormed off? Do not know what the deal was but this is just plain unprofessional and creepy behavior. The waitresses will smack into you while you are eating...man what a mess this place is from top to bottom.
The food just OK at best! I am seriously complimenting them here... you can do better at home than here. Seriously I am not going to go into you have been warned just yuk...OK? these other folks with the positive reviews for this place must burn off their taste buds with adult beverages. (Didn't try the sake it may be the high point of the joint...but why would I want to expose my taste buds to a substandard meal to enjoy some rice wine? I can do this at home.
 Here is something I am not sure of, I have only lived here a few months now, is it customary to charge for each soda every time you get a refill here? I was charged for each I asked why they said "This is how we do it here." So at $2 bucks per 6-8 ounces of beverage you may want to go with water at this place...but smarter yet! Go elsewhere.
I will not be returning to this establishment.

Worst yet.
--------------------
I've been to Mount Laurel's On the Border over 50 times. I used to go to Don Pablo's but I fell in love with On the Border's chips and salsa (their chips are nice and salty, and their salsa is a little spicier).

When I go, 90% of the time I just sit at the bar and drink beer and snack on their chips and salsa. The beer specials are pretty good but could be a little better- weekdays has a happy hour as well as a late night happy hour too.

When I do dine, I often just enjoy a variety of vegetarian sides. Lately, I've grown to enjoy their cheese enchiladas, which I find delicious. Service when dining is usually great.

As for the bartenders, it's really hit-or-miss. Joann is probably my favorite- she's friendly, attentive, funny, and I've really gotten to know her, and I'd give them 5 stars if my experience was with her alone. There is a bartender named Nikki though, and if she's there, I always get the worst service. She barely checks on me/us to see how we're doing, she seems unfriendly, if she actually comes to refill your chips then she will not refill your salsa, she has taken my beer and refilled it without asking (when I was done and trying to leave), and I've had to wait forever to ask her for my check. At least twice, I've had to ask other bartenders to bring my check so that I could finally close out and leave. I'd give them 1 star if my experience was based on her alone.

Overall, good appetizers, cold beer, moderate prices, and usually good service.
--------------------
First of all, I think this might be my first Yelp review about "fast food." It's not a genre I ever eat unless I'm forced to on a road trip.  However, I am from Buffalo, NY, and am a chicken-finger connoisseur, so I decided to give this place a chance.  Additionally, it was on a road trip of sorts.  We had been at the beach all day and were halfway back home to central Tampa.

The service is amazing!  I have never seen fast-food workers who take so much pride in their jobs.  These people were drinking the Zaxby's cool-aid!  They seemed more like Disney employees than fast-food workers.  Both a female counter gal and a male (possible the manager/franchisee) went out of their way to make sure we liked everything.  

The food was a solid 4 stars, but my review overall is rounded up for the above mentioned points.  We had the chicken finger sandwiches on Texas toast.  While the chicken fingers themselves were super juicy and moist, the Texas toast was too greasy to eat them on.  I love sauce and enjoyed the variety.  We tried the Zax, hot honey mustard, insane hot and ranch.  What is missing from the sauce variety, for me, is a spicy bbq and blue cheese.  Serving ranch with hot sauce is an insult to the folks in Buffalo that created the cuisine.  Aside from the bread and sauce small issues, I really enjoyed our meal.  Additionally, it was so cheap!!  $12 and change for 2 meals with drinks.  

I am a fan!  This place doesn't quite hit all the marks of Buffalo-Inspired food, but it does a pretty good job of putting a southern twist on chicken fingers!
--------------------
When I was preparing to write this review and give Sam's a particular number of stars, I encountered a dilemma.  Should my star rating be based upon comparing Sam's to all Sports Bars in which I have ever been?  Or, should it be a comparison to Nashville Sports Bars?

I chose the former:  compared to everywhere - because if you're from out of town that only seemed fair.  The sad news is that for a vibrant southeastern city where we have two professional sports teams, our sports bars kinda suck.

Sam's is honestly one of two great sports bars in the city.  I really like Sam's and I really like the patio in Spring, Summer, and early Autumn.  But, when compared to so many sports bars across the country in other cities of comparable size with their own sports' teams... Sam's is just mediocre.  

The service is always a toss up, and the ladies dressed in those referee outfits - could you not find some attractive Southern women to put on those booty shorts and v-cut referee shirts?  Some of the regular old-time employees who have been there since I was in undergrad - a decade ago - really should not be wearing tight clothes.  Wow.  That was just really mean.  I'm sorry.

The food is on the better side of bar fare.  But their beer selection could want for some better beers and a wider variety of selection.  The mixed drinks tend to be a bit weak, in my opinion.

But, hey, it's a bar.  It has lots of TVs and they play the game commentary over the speakers throughout the bar.  All and all, if you want to watch sports at a bar, then I would recommend Sam's.

I absolutely love this hotel. It is certainly one of my favorites. Upon walking into the building, to your right you will enter the lobby. The lobby is adorable with eclectic decorations and 1 million places to sit that are very comfortable. They serve wine every day from 5 to 6 PM, it's nice to relax down in the lobby with a glass of wine and friendly staff..

Speaking of the staff, they are amazing. Checking in is fantastic, Jasmine and Kayla are the ones I dealt with and they are both wonderful. The hotel concierge Roshid is a very friendly and knowledgeable concierge, they are very lucky to have him on staff. The housekeepers are great, the rooms are immaculate. What I love most about this hotel are the fantastic bathrooms, I'm not sure about the regular rooms, but if you get a king spa room, the bathrooms are absolutely amazing. You have a freestanding tub, and a large shower and you can jump in between the two should you be so inclined ha ha. The decor is so attractive, incredible wallpaper, beautiful rugs, everything seems brand new and they keep it in perfect condition. This hotel is a must for anyone visiting Philadelphia. They make you feel right at home at the moment you step in the door. The pictures that you can get from inside the rooms are enough to make up your whole trip to Philly LOL. But if you want to get out and explore Philly you're only steps away from the Liberty Bell and a historical museum. Right in Center City or the old downtown area, you'll find lots of historical information about Philadelphia.  Definitely stop in and stay at the Monaco, you won't regret it!
--------------------
If you are visiting Indianapolis, I highly suggest this hotel. My boyfriend and I went just for one night and used his AAA discount which saved us a lot. They have a parking structure attached to the hotel for $20 a night. Starting at the garage they had such cool urban art that continue throughout our stay. The check in was an easy process and the service was amazing. Everywhere you turn there is another interesting piece of art work to look at. Our room was very nice, keurig coffee machine,large luxurious shower, comfy robes, and comfortable california king. We had tickets to the Pacers game which worked out perfectly. We had drinks and dinner before the game at Plat 99 which is in the hotel- again more great decor. They had a whole timeline of cocktails and complementary truffle popcorn. (they also had a really cool outdoor rooftop seating area for the bar, but was too cold and snowy to go out on) Bankers Field house was maybe 1 minute away walking. After the game we came back and got some drinks at Plat 99 again, it was pretty crowded, fun environment. For breakfast we ate at the Market Place downstairs, it was one set price for a buffet and had a lot of good food.

We checked out at 11am- very easy and the concierge was friendly and helpful. Before we left we spent about 30 minutes just walking around the hotel looking at all the art work, it is like a modern art museum. 

Overall we loved this hotel, for a quick getaway to Indianapolis, especially if you are going to a Pacers or Colts game, is was fantastic. Next time I go back to Indianapolis I will be staying here again.
--------------------
Broussard's was pretty good when I went there a few weeks ago. I had a Groupon that was about to expire so I took my parents out to dinner.  I knew going in that Broussards is a very old skool New Orleans restaurant, and it is very nice when you walk in to see the old tile on the walls in the foyer of the building. The courtyard is beautiful and I just had to turn into a tourist and take a picture in front of the fountain with my mom. We were seated and very promptly greeted by the drink guy.  He brought us our water and told us about the extensive wine list, but they were of course out of the Pinot Grigio that I ordered.  He successfully suggested a Chardonnay for me instead and I was happy. The head waiter came out and explained with great detail the specials for the night, but I went for menu regulars, the maytag blue cheese salad and the pecan crusted drum. I wanted more salad, it was so good, I ate it up so fast. The drum was excellent too. It had this soy butter sauce on it that was so good and topped with crawfish. I was definitely happy with my meal and glad I had the experience. What makes me knock off two stars is that though the foyer's vintage appeal is nice and the courtyard is beautiful, I feel like the dining room needs an upgrade.  The chandeliers on the walls in the main dining room are very reminiscent of the hallways of my grandmother's assisted living home. I think its just one of those places I am glad to say I've been to, but I don't think I will choose to go there again.
--------------------
Really disappointed. I've been to the Marathon at 18/Spruce and had excellent service, drinks and food. Thought that would transfer to this location - not at all.

To sum it up, our server was extremely energetic, but not in a good way. More like a frantic energy. I was there to enjoy a few drinks and dinner with a friend who was visiting (AKA looking to spend money AKA you will get a larger tip if you let us stay longer) and we were rushed out. Server brought boxes for food we were still eating, without asking if we wanted them. A few minutes later he physically put the food in the boxes at the tableside while mumbling something like "I don't like food sitting on the table." .....we didn't even want to take it home. Next, when we said we were having another friend join for another round or two of drinks he told us we couldn't stay at the booth we were at and we needed to go to the bar. What? I point blank asked him if he was kicking us out of the booth and he said "yes!" energetically. There was no one waiting for tables and there were numerous open tables/booths around the restaurant. I felt extremely uncomfortable and wanted to leave immediately. Our friend joined after all this happened, and when the server came over to ask if they wanted a drink, he seemed surprised when we told him we were just going to leave. YOU LITERALLY just told us we couldn't sit at this table any longer!! We then left.

I worked in restaurants for a long time and I'm pretty easy to please when it comes to restaurant service. I was not pleased at all during this visit.

On another note, the food was not that great.
--------------------
I could say that this is a touch of Italy in a strip mall, but even I recognize that is a little too precious. Stepping into the dark, cool interior of Sapore made for a refreshing change after the sweltering July heatwave. It was no problem for our party of three to be seated; the fact that we had a reservation helped, I am sure. We started out with drinks--bellinis for my two dinner companions and a classic vodka martini for me. I appreciated being able to customize my drink with a blue-cheese-stuffed olive and an anchovy. I would never have thought to put an anchovy in a martini, but it looks like this will be a new obsession for me. 

On to the food. We opted to skip the appetizers and go straight to soup/salad and entrees (all the better to save room for dessert). My mom went with the Italian soup and my other dining companion and I split the Caprese salad, a solid presentation that did not blow me away, but certainly does not provide grist for anything like the negative reviews of this establishment that I have seen on yelp. I didn't know what to expect in terms of pasta portions here, so I went with the Chicken Marsala. It might have been nice to have pasta to pick up some of the sauce, but I appreciated that the dish was hot by temperature and I even had enough for leftovers (to which I added pasta, in the comfort and convenience of my home).

The dessert selection was excellent. We went with the tiramisu. I understand Sapore also has an excellent cannoli which I would like to try on a future visit. I would be tempted to come back, if only for another excellent martini, appetizers, and another run through the dessert menu.
--------------------
As a childless woman I wasn't sure how I was going to enjoy my experience here but I give the good folks at Chuck E Cheese credit....they do run a fairly tight ship. There are lots of staff running around both on the floors and behind the counters so whether you need to order another sample platter or get a refund after a machine ate your token you will never be stuck waiting too long. There is also staff at the door and they do stamp the kids to make sure they don't wander away on their own or with somebody they do not know.

I like that all the games here are just one token. There are also quite a few different types of games available from Arcade style to games of chance. One thing I did notice is that the game area is larger then the play area which means your kiddo's are more likely to want to spend their time here and your likely going to be reaching for your wallet on more then one occasion.

There was a decent amount of food sent to our birthday party table and even with six kids and five adults there was still pizza left over. I did find the birthday area to be a little crowded and we did on more then one instance accidentally back our chairs into people from the neighboring party table. 

The staff here were great and very attentive making sure all the special birthday rock stars were well looked after. I don't know how many times I would really need to come into a place like this as I don't have that many friends with kids but it was great to see them enjoying themselves as well as reliving some fond memories from my own trips to Chuck E Cheese as a little girl.

Wildflower is a super scrum, cute little restaurant. I've been here twice now for lunch, unfortunately I am always too late for breakfast. Fortunately though, their lunch is delicious! I took my mum here for her birthday for lunch and we were both so pleased!! 

Sad to say, but due to some health issues, I've had to really change my diet around. This was my first time going out to eat since being on this new regimen. I'm definitely limited, which is too bad, and there was a lot I couldn't have. The menu has good selections, but there is a lot with meat, and I've been a vegetarian for years. Regardless, they serve great food, I just like big menus. Everything is made in house and they use fresh and local ingredients. My mum got the Vermonter salad, which she LOVED!!! It had mixed greens, Vermont cheddar, applewood smoked bacon, pecans, and dried cherries. The dressing was a home made honey vinaigrette I believe. It came with two delicious pieces of muesli bread with a home made honey butter. YUM!! I had the tuna plate, which was great too. It had a very good portion of tuna salad, mixed greens, mixed veggies, and came with a biscuit with that delicious honey butter. It also came with a fresh fruit bowl!!!! I couldn't have the biscuit so I traded for muesli and man that stuff was delicious. My mum loves the biscuit too. Everything is definitely made with love and happiness here!!!

The patio is so cute, 4 tables on a nice little deck with fans and hanging lights. Our server was wonderful, SO kind and adorable. She even brought my mum
a homemade red velvet cupcake with a candle, which LOOKED amazing, and she thought was delicious. Another win at Wildflower, would love to come back for breakfast sometime.
--------------------
Delicious food, sub-par service. I stopped into this dessert bar today to grab some dessert and a coffee to-go. While everyone seemed to be very helpful, or at least wanting to be, I'm not sure I received the best possible service. I ordered two slices of cake, one marshmallow chocolate and one cheesecake. Both were DELICIOUS, but it seemed like I waited forever to receive these, and when i did, it was in a cute but inefficient manner. The to-go boxes were stacked one on top of the other, with a loosely tied string around them. While I admire the aesthetics here, I would have much preferred a bag. Though, the worst part of my experience was the barista. I ordered an iced coffee with milk and sugar. First, he put ice in the cup and filled it halfway with coffee. He then asked me to pick and put in my own sugars from a cup of packets as he stated "I wouldn't know what and how much you want, I only drink my coffee black." As I considered this incompetent statement, i expected him to then put more hot coffee in to help the sugar dissolve. But no, he proceeded to fill the rest of the HALF OF THE CUP with milk. And then handing me the drink he told me I'd better stir it to mix the cream and sugar in. Not sure why I'd paid such a high price to practically make my own half-coffee half-mild beverage, I simply smiled and walked away. I ended up throwing out the drink as I could hardly even taste the coffee and I'm not too fond of a lot of milk in my coffee. Nonetheless, the cakes were delicious, and I will be coming back with the hopes that this new business is still in the process of improving itself.
--------------------
I was really between 3 and 4 stars for this one. I LOVE the 96th street Naked Tchopstix so I was very excited to see this one which is closer to my house.
The vibe is totally different as this is geared more to take out although they do have a decent size dining area. You order at the counter and they deliver it.
My daughter and I tried the sushi bowl. You pick up a piece of paper and  select from a choice of proteins, vegetables, rice and toppings. I like the fact that it is on paper and you don't have to guess what things are or have to shout over the counter to tell the server what you want. The sushi bowl was good but not wonderful. The choices particularly of the vegetables seemed a little too limiting and I felt I had more rice than other food items. The sauces were tasty. My husband ordered the Maui roll which is my favorite roll at the 96th street location and this just was not up that standard. It was good but the quality and consistently was not as good as at 96th street. I would go back though and I think a lot of people would be happy with the sushi bowls. I do want to make a comment about the low reviews that people have given the place because of service. People - it is a sushi place - it isn't McDonalds- so it will be a bit slower. You are not going to order and get out of there in five minutes even though it is called express. As a healthy alternative to fast food in the area, it is worth the wait. Oh and try the bubble tea. I had the strawberry and it was quite yummy. Next time I am going to try the vanilla chai.
--------------------
I've only eaten here twice and my experience has been great overall. The first time I went, they had just opened. There were some kinks but not anything I would complain about. After all, our group had 8 people so it was understandable. Second time was probably a month later and I noticed they figured out some of the kinks. Their servers are nice and I genuinely felt like they wanted to make my experience great. I know this because every time I made a request the waiter would literally run to get it. I've never seen a server so dedicated, kudos! Honestly most of the stars I'm giving them is because of their genuine service. Added bonus, they were playing Star Trek, hunger games, and iron man. Nice movie selections haha.

The seafood was ok. It's not their fault; it's Tucson so you know you really can't get fresh seafood. That's why I took off a star. They have 1 type of sauce with mild, medium, hot spiciness. It's similar to angry crab's "trifecta" or boiling crab's, "the whole shabang" but with an Asian twist. It was good in my opinion.

Lastly, if anyone has ever gone to angry crab, hot n juicy, boiling crab, should know that the price range is similar. Heck, if anyone has ever bought raw seafood at the store should know that it is on the expensive side. Expensive? Yes. Overpriced? No. I have been to many seafood places similar to this and it's a decent price for what you get. My advice for the Dungeness crab, since it did happen to me at other places and I saw a review on it here, is to share it or get their other selections that they can measure out. The dungeness crab is a full crab so finding a 1 lb dungeness crab is not common. 

Would recommend and go again.
--------------------
The worst Italian food I have ever tasted!!! I'm far from Italian, but I can make a MEAN lasagna & spaghetti myself compared to this place. 1st of all, we waited 45mins patiently w/ a hungry Hubby, 2yr old, 7yr old, & myself. When we finally got seated, the waitress was very polite, but forgetful at times. Didnt drink any alcohol or sodas but the lemonade was very tart & the garlic bread was not-so-fresh...had to request for some fresh bread after my family devoured the 1st basket from starving & waiting for so long. I ordered the stuffed shells & chicken parmagiana. The salad was very tasty; however, they only have Italian dressing...no ranch or anything else. I am not a picky eater & rarely complain, but the stuffed shells & parmagiana chicken tasted HORRIBLE!! The chicken was very bland & the stuffed shells were hard & overbaked. The meranera sauce tasted like it was old or aged too long (if there's ever such a thing, lol). I could not bring myself to eat my entree. I had to send it back. I heard the lady at the table next to ours say the salmon was good, so I figured the salmon might be safe. It was actually very good! I was still very disappointed after this restaurant was referred to me by many. I felt like they got an easy $50 bucks out of me. I would have rathered gone to the olive garden or macaroni grill. If u r looking for an awesome authentic Italian cusine restaurant in Tucson, I highly recommend Contessa off of Ina Rd. The only reason we didn't go there is b/c it was out of the way from where we were going.  It's pretty far from where we live but always worth the drive. Everything is freshly made & u can definite tell the difference! I'm sorry Caruso, but I don't think my family will be coming here ever again!
--------------------
A quasi political rant and a store review all wrapped in one, so enjoy. 

Ever since Target hit the scene I really have to ask, "Who even goes to Kmart anymore?" I asked this to myself out loud the other day as I had to get my meds filled due to a sinus infection. No one looked at me odd, as there seemed to be several people talking to themselves. I now go here because of the stolid contractual war between Express Scripts and Walgreens. Thanks you two....idiots.....qausi-political rant over.

This store is harshly bright, rather dingy, and the selections, especially in the electronic section, are on the cheaper end.  On top of that, I've found the mainstream DVD and Blu-Ray movies are overpriced.  I laughed at the men's area, especially the young man's department, as they had a tv with music videos playing. I laughed because it just seemed a lame attempt to be cool and creating a shopping experience that you will find at a department store like Macy's or Dillard's. This is hard to create when everything is whitewashed. You will feel like you are in that August Burns Red's "Whitewashed."  The best WTF moment is discovering the opportunity to purchase Joe Boxer male thongs. Who knew that Kmart cared about male panty line?

One great tip is you can find patio furniture cheap during the off season and clearance days. I bought a great patio table for under $50. So, keep that in mind.

The extra star is for the pharmacy, as they filled my prescription out efficiently and with the greatest of ease. The hours are little later than Target.  No problems there and credit when credit is due!

The later 80s quote, "K-Mart sucks", remains as true as ever and who knows, you may even bump into someone who still dresses from that Tom Cruise era who cares about male panty line. One never knows?

This place is absolutely amazing. A cute little bakery and the employees are super attentive. I walked in and was bouncing around from one dessert to another deciding if I should make a purchase. The employee offered me a sample of the banana puddings - definitely try some! And you know how sometimes when they give you so small of a sample to taste, you can't really make a proper judgment because there isn't enough to judge from? Not the case here!

I got the salted caramel banana, the strawberry banana pudding and the upside pineapple cake.

Thoughts: OMG!! I never crave banana pudding and never really thought anything of the dessert. But man after this, I wanted to go home and make my own banana pudding (Although I highly doubt that I could make it half as good)! Their desserts are crafted perfect - three/four layers depending on what you get. The bottom layer the the pudding, second layer is the nilla wafers or they might even use some sort of pound cake(whatever it was - it was AMAZING), third layer, the strawberry and then the top layer is pudding with a nice whipped creme and topping. The creme has so much flavor and the texture is so smooth. Everything just comes together so nicely! 

The upside pineapple cake was BOMB. the cake wasn't too fluffy but was dense to the perfect amount to Taste like what it's suppose to. The pineapple flavor isn't overwhelming but just right. My only problem was that the pineapple bottom got a little too carameliZed with brown sugar and was a bit hard to chew.

Definitely go to this place! I was so sad that there was no option to leave them a tip. (They use an iPad to ring you up). The service/help was so great and I would have left a tip but I had no cash. Any ways, highly recommend this place for desserts!!

We were a bit weary about trying the Shellfish Company on the Wharf as more often than not, many places like these (see Cannery Row, Monterey) feast on a captive audience and provide sub-standard fare at high prices.

However, emboldened by the perennial good reviews on Yelp, we suppressed our initial observations and went ahead with the trying it out. The place is small, so definitely plan ahead. You will have to wait, so either you know, just do so, or perhaps try to visit outside of peak hours. Luckily, our wait was only about 20 minutes as the dinner rush was just leveling off.

The special was the local rock crab - $25 for 3 lbs of California Rock Crab, salad, and your choice of soup/chowder. After taking a look at a few trays of rock crab being served out, the wife and I both opted for it, as it looked awesome.  

The salad/chowder combo was great as you actually received hearty portions of each, so it was a good start. As much as I liked the chowder however, the Shrimp Bisque the wife ordered was amazing, so I would recommend that going forward. 

But enough of prattling on about side dishes: the rock crab tasted just as glorious as it looked. Juicy, buttery chunks of white crab meat await you, just a few cracks away. While the rock crab shells are pretty thick, once cracked, they splinter and separate easily, a good sign they are cooked to perfection. The rock crabs provided a great amount of meat for what I felt to be the least amount of work you're going to do for crab, King or otherwise. 

We were thoroughly satisfied with our meal and along with the special being an overall great value, devouring the Rock Crab at SBSC turned out to be one of the favorite meals on the trip. I think ordering crab here is a safe proposition indeed.

What an AMAZING occurrence that we ended up here after another barbecue place ran out of food!

So yeah, we started out at another spot and they were out of food when we got there. Super bummed and still in the mood for barbecue, we started wandering around Mid City and my trusty Yelp app guided me to this place. We were greeted by the super nice woman working the counter and she explained the whole process.

I decided to get the one-meat plate with "wet" pulled pork, grits and potato salad, I also got a medium mac and cheese, because I can. My boyfriend got the two-meat plate with brisket and pulled chicken with potato salad and fries. The food blew us both away! It was delicious from beginning to end. The pulled pork was perfect and had the perfect amount of sauce without being drenched. I could tell that if I hadn't ordered it wet it still would have been able to stand on it's own. The mac and cheese was incredible, and after the pork, was my favorite part of the meal. The stone ground grits had a different type of flavor (almost smoky) that I enjoyed and the potato salad was served cold and had that nice crunch that I like in potato salad,

We both agreed that the food was excellent, and a good deal to boot, and that we would both make the trip back out to Earhart, just to have more of this delicious food. The owner himself was bringing the food out to folks and he was really friendly and made sure that we were happy with everything. I like when the owners take the time to make sure that everything is okay. The atmosphere is casual and comfortable and the entire process was a breeze. I will definitely return to LA Smokehouse and I'll be adding it to my "BBQ Favorites" list for future reference.

im going to have to give this place one star for its horrible customer service:

i called in to ask about the 50% off for tulane students they were advertising, the woman assured me if i came with an id it would be half off and made an appointment for me, only once i got there did they tell me it's only on certain days, "it says it right on the sign," i was perturbed by the inconvenience and said so you're not going to honor it even though you just made an appointment with me and told me it would be 50% off, they said no flat out at first even though the error was blatantly on their side, after my nagging, she eventually called john jay himself and he told the woman that he would not honor what i was told even though i had been inconvenienced by someone in HIS staff because it might cause a 'domino effect,' i said how will there be a domino effect unless you continue to give people incorrect information, there will be no other 'dominoes' as long as you remember what day it is from now on... they began to treat me somewhat patronizingly as i explained that usually businesses make concessions when they are the one at fault, that the customer is supposed to always be right, yadda yadda yadda, i left pretty upset and with ~45 minutes of my life having been wasted - empty handed but for a lame excuse from someone who owns at least 3 businesses over 10 dollars...

i have not received a haircut from them so if you're one of those people who ONLY cares about the product and you think you'll get a good cut go right on ahead, but if you're like me (principled) and you don't like handing profits to people who care nothing about their customers this is a good place to skip next time you need a cut
--------------------
I'm giving this joint 4 stars because they have earned it, but they are definitely 5 star material, if they work out a few kinks. Granted, they just opened, so some of the errors I've experienced (I work in the area, so I've been there several times) will probably get worked out and they are more than willing to make corrections and accommodations when they mess up. 

But over all, the food is REALLY good. Unlike my fellow Yelp-ers, I would say that ther pizza is not their strong suit - its kinds greasy and not sure if they use 100% mozzarella - tastes like its cut with something cheaper. However, so far I've had:  

The Quaker (Chicken version) - Delicious. They make their chicken steaks with the chunky chicken, which I like much more than the shredded version. They could season the chicken more, but the cheese was melted perfectly and the veggies were fresh. 

The fries - crisp and flavorful. I didn't even need ketchup, and I always eat ketchup on my fries

The onion rings - a little greasy, but very tasty and crisp. The onions stayed in the breading and didn't slide out when you bit them (which I hate). 

Spanakopita - mine was a little over cooked, but the flavors were really good

Baklava - VERY GOOD! 

Signature Salad - The veggies they use are very fresh which will make or break a salad. Their balsamic is great too!

The (turkey) Greek Burger - one of the best turkey burgers I've ever had! The patty was moist and flavorful all on its own, but then they top it with what must be homemade tzatziki. I could eat a bowl of that stuff! My burger had romaine instead of the advertised arugula, but it was very fresh, so I didn't mind as much. I also asked for feta, which I didn't get, but that sauce made me forget all about it. 

Overall, this place is great! Provided they don't stray from the high quality standard they are setting, I will keep going back.
--------------------
Went here based on the high ratings and raves from people.  The entire experience was underwhelming from start to finish.  Their website which is fairly useless if you want to figure out the menu before going, you have to pick your location choice out of 3 locations and then drill down to the bottom to see the weak descriptions of their menu offering, no explanations and no price, just this

    Roast Beef
    Roast Beef Combo
    Roast Pork
    Roast Pork Combo
    Baked Ham
    Baked Ham Combo
    Roast Turkey
    Roast Turkey Combo
    Broccoli Rabe
    Broccoli Rabe Combo


No explanation of whats in a combo (its just where they add cheese by the way)

The table placecard (instead of menu) had a more detailed description than the website.  

When I walked in, its more bar than restaurant, no big deal, but there were tables.  Since I couldnt decide and the sandwiches werent too expensive at $6.85, I got the roast beef and roast port combos.

I got my two sandwiches fast enough, but the roast beef was cold and the roast pork was hot.  Not sure how a cook (for lack of a better word) could serve 2 things at the same time with such a temperature differential, one was obviously sitting for awhile.  I asked the waitress to reheat the roast beef while I finished the roast pork, and supposedly it was reheated, since it was warmer, but it was still cold-ish compared to my roast pork I had just finished.  The waitress did offer to replace it when she inquired, but I was in a hurry and didnt really care for a hot version of this sandwich.

The sandwiches were very skimpy on meat, but they "made up for it" by adding too much gravy to make it overly messy and the bread was disintegrating.  The menu place card mentions the "wet meat" option where you get less gravy, I strongly recommend you get it that style, especially if the gravy overpower the meat and structural integrity of the sandwich.

Rosemary's Grill is my favorite resaurant.  My wife and I take my Mother in law to Rosemary's Grill often for many reasons.  Their menu is extensive.  You can get Classic American food in many categories prepared fresh and delicious with great care and attention to detail that is lacking in common chain restaurants.  You can also get traditional Turkish cuisine that is the very best kebab that I ever had.  Rosemary's is a family owned business and they treat you like you are part of that family.  We are making Rosemary's our Saturday night place.  last weekend my wife and I took my. Mother in law to Rosemary's Grill for dinner.  It was even better that the time before.  I tried the Mixed grill kebab platter.  Lamb, Chicken, Adana, and gyro kebab meats, so tender and expertly spiced and grilled, along with a shepherds salad, grilled half tomatoes, rice, and of course flat bread.  The Adana kebab was particularly tender, juicy, and tasty.  I had never had Adana kebab before and will be ordering it again.  I shared a taste with my Mother in law and she loved it too!  mom in law had crab cakes and she enjoyed them very much.  My wife had the French onion soup, which she raves about and always orders.  She also had the roast turkey, mashed potatoes, cranberry sauce, and corn.  She loved everything on that platter.  She commented that the gravy was especially good.  The portion sizes are huge and we love to have the left overs again at home.  I have honestly not been to a restaurant in the area that has such good quality in all there entrees, sides, salad bar, and drinks, and you have to try the rice pudding.  We have eaten a few times here for breakfast, lunch, and dinner and it continues to be our very favorite place.  The waitstaff and owners make you feel right at home and are warm, welcoming, and friendly.  I can not say enough good things.

Have only been once a couple of months ago, so maybe this was a one-off experience...Ordered a piece of carrot cake, which tasted fine. Certainly not the best I've ever had but good enough. The to go packaging was a bit overkill just for that one slice of cake, as was the $10 price tag. That being said, I'm sure the "fanciness" of the place is what makes it so appealing to folks. It really is quite unique and cute for our area and would be a good place to go with the gals (rather than my husband who hates all things trendy, lol). 

My problem, though, was with the service. We placed our order for the carrot cake with a nice young teenager, and then waited. And waited. I could see the carrot cake just sitting in the pretty covered cake stand, and I felt really tempted to just slice it myself. After a bit (felt like 10 minutes, although I'm sure it was more like 5 or 6), another employee came and sliced the carrot cake, setting the slice on the back counter with the ticket. And then we waited. And waited some more. After about another 5 to 10 minutes, I flagged the teenager down and asked if he could box up the cake for us. He seemed confused, and it took an awkward minute-long exchange for him to understand we hadn't yet received our order. He did apologize for the wait, which I do appreciate, boxed up the cake, and then we were on our way.

I should clarify that we did not go into the shop at a busy time. It was a relatively cool day and not many people were out. While there were maybe 2 to 3 tables seated, we were the only ones at the counter ordering. And while I'm sure the wait staff who repeatedly walked by our lonely piece of carrot cake sitting on the back counter had many important tasks...I just wanted to eat my $10 cake.

Four stars for the cake. Two stars for the service.
--------------------
I stayed at the Orange St location from Friday to Monday.

Arrival: I already read plenty of reviews about no signs marking the location therefore, I looked for Starbucks. I parked in a spot in front of the multi business complex. I went inside to find a guard at a desk that said we have been contracted to hand guests their keys and room number and nothing more. He advised me there was a phone that was on the wall that I could make a call to someone if I needed to. He also stated that the very few parking spots in front were free* only on the weekend.

The Room: This wasn't a room, this was an apartment and I absolutely loved it. It was very spacious and had everything I sought* after for that weekend, such as: fully stocked kitchen, a desk, lots of space, king bed, huge table, nice living room, lots of closets. My only complaint is that I could not open any windows for fresh air...they are nailed/screwed shut. There was also a small welcome bag w cookies and water and papers letting you know where all the food delivery locations and numbers.
There wasn't maid service knocking loudly or trying to barge in early in the morning. This place is more of a long term setting and I'm sure the maids come around during the week Monday-Friday if you desire. I was only here for 3 days and I was fine with that. I went shopping at Shoprite and filled my fridge with water and breakfast to cook.

Overall: This place is awesome, I had a huge living room to entertain my guests when they visited, and a nice desk to study my Anatomy notes. I forgot to mention how quiet** this place is. I loved it. I felt as if no one was there except me. Very quiet* which worked for me on Sunday bc I had lots of studying to do and two TV's to watch The Walking Dead on. Lol!  I would most definitely stay here again. Very spacious and updated. Loved it!
--------------------
This was our first time here. I had a coupon so I thought I would try it out. Pulling into the parking lot I noticed it was very busy. I was worried that I would have to wait a long time. I pulled up to the attendant and asked how long it would be for a reg wash. She said each wash takes about 15 minutes. I was surprised since they were busy. I left the car there and proceeded inside. 

The building is huge inside. One side is all windows so you can watch your vehicle move through. They even have a "soap gun" the kids can use to shoot their car. That was a huge hit. 

The cashier greeted me as I walked up to the counter. She took my coupon and handed me a receipt. I walked around while I was waiting. They have drinks she snacks for purchase. They sell lots of greeting cards for every occasion. They have gifts and accessories for your car. The building was cool inside which was great because it was hot the day we came in. I waited about 10 minutes and walked outside. They have a large covered area to wait under. It has some seating so you can sit and wait. After just a few minutes they yelled out my car make to say it was done. I handed the attendant my receipt and tip and I was on my way. Total time was 18 minutes which I think is fair considering they were packed when I arrived. 

The car was clean and vacuumed. Overall they did a great job. The only thing they missed was the front window. It had that haze on it that you notice when the sun hits its. I wiped it off myself. I'm sure they would have fixed it if I noticed before I left. Also, they don't offer free air freshener with the wash like most other places. 

This place was fast and they did a great job. The price was fair and the staff was friendly. I will be coming back soon.
--------------------
Would it be weird if I wanted to move in and permanently live here!? The style of this salon is impeccable. The color palette and decor they chose makes it feel like you're in a Restoration Hardware magazine...in France...surrounded by heirloom antiques. I didn't know what to expect when arriving but I was pleasantly surprised with their upscale polish options like Chanel and many others I actually didn't know I needed in my life until I arrived. 
Service was prompt and I especially enjoyed the extended massage. Most importantly the tools she used were brand new/ had been sterilized. I watched her open the fresh package up, that made me feel good about cleanliness and safety. I don't know if all nail salons have cute gold tips on their nail trimmer tools but now I want them for my own collection. 

I picked a gray color for my toes and did OPI Funny Bunny gel on my nails. So far I'm loving both! 
So nice to see a high end nail salon finally making its way to Nashville. I've gone to others in Nashville that seem to be high end, but it just ends up like a VIP club on the Vegas strip with loud music and sparkles just waiting for a Justin Bieber song to come on. 
CURED was not only high end, but it was classic. Like The Hamptons type of classic but with a comfortable low key brunch with girlfriends mimosa type of vibe. I think it would be amazing for a bridal party with so many photo opportunities. I felt comfortable with their prices, competitive to anywhere else I've gone in Nashville worth mentioning. 

I didn't know where to park so I parked on the side in a random parking lot. Looks like there's a lot of up and coming businesses beside them under construction. So I'm assuming once those are complete, parking will be pretty straight forward? 

When my Mom & Sister come into town next I'm going to take them here & go to Local Honey for lunch since it's so close. 

Can't wait to go back. Welcome to the neighborhood!

When my daughter was about a year-and-a-half old, Linda, the owner, helped me out by taking her for a drop in a couple times. My daughter is now four and a half and I have a one-and-a-half-year-old son. I switched school districts from Carson to Washoe and I kept going to all of these other daycare places and not getting a great feel, as well as the fact that they were totally booked for having an infant\toddler. I needed a place for both of my kids and there was just no where for my son..... My gut kept telling me go back to Circle of Friends. I've been extremely happy. Are there always going to be kids who attended daycare that I do not agree with their behavior? absolutely! There is no way to get around that whether it is in school, daycare, or a sports team or some other organized deal. I try the best of my ability to not let those other children's behaviors influence my own and we talk about it. Well the best you can for a 4 year old! I really like Linda and the whole staff. She has a little turnover and I really like that. The first place that my kids were at in Carson had turn over all the time..... The second place was a home daycare so she didn't turn over herself, and the other place was a mother and daughter run joint as well. They had very little turnover. That's important to me that employees stick around. So, my kid has been flourishing both emotionally and academically. She's picking up things that I'm totally surprised about.... Like starfish have two stomachs and octopus have 9 brains.... I didn't believe her and I had to Google them! I didn't read the Yahoo review, but people are always going to have mixed situations with whatever's going on for them. All I know is that Linda and her daughter helped me out greatly when I was in need several years ago, and she helped me out greatly this time and it's been a great fit. I'm very happy and content.
--------------------
Never been to this location before, never had a problem with any other location. It was almost full but there were a handful of tables open. We began to seat ourselves and was told we could sit anywhere. They came and took our drink order pretty quickly and we received them within a few minutes, the girl who delivered our drinks said they would be back to take our order.  I'd say it was almost 10 minutes before they finally came and took out order. I started to wonder who our waitress was because 2 different females took the drink order and delivered them. Finally, one of the females came and took our order, so we must have been there for 15 minutes at least before our food order was taken. 10 minutes had gone by and a lady got sat in the booth next to us. Another 10 minutes later, she got her food before we did. So she got there after us, ordered after us, but received hers before us. Our waitress refilled my husband's coffee twice the whole time and she asked if I wanted a refill on my soda, I shook my head no and she could tell we were wondering where our food was, she says your food is almost ready, the kitchen is overwhelmed right now. But there was only maybe one new customer that came in since we had been there. I told my husband if we didn't get our food in the next 5 minutes, we would just leave.  So, 40 minutes and no food, we walked to the register and asked if we could pay for our beverages and our waitress said our food was almost ready. I said that we didn't want to wait anymore and she said we didn't have to pay for our drinks and we left. No apology, nothing. Im thinking either our waitress forgot to enter our order, or, the 3 cooks in the kitchen just wasn't concerned about how fast the food was being cooked. They did not look flustered, so I honestly don't know what the issue was. Won't be returning. Waste of our time.

Dearest Reader,

Please allow me to hereby confirm the rumors: Village Whiskey does, in fact, have the best burger in Philadelphia. And, I should note, some of the best bartenders. 

As my wife and I sat at the bar waiting for our friends to arrive, I marveled at the infinite selection of whiskeys and bourbons. I decided that this, self, is the day you will begin liking whiskey. So I petitioned the bartender to "make me something awesome with whiskey in it." "What kind of drink do you want?," he inquired. "I have no idea, good sir. You see, I am a neophyte, a tyro, and fledgling when it comes to spirits such as these." (Perhaps my banter wasn't quite at this level at the time; I was already a few drinks in from my visit to Franklin Mortgage, but this is how I remember it going.) So, he thought about it for a while and proceeded to mix up the craziest drink I had ever seen -- it had whiskey, orange bitters, an egg white, Portuguese red wine, and other stuff in it! The verdict: delicious. I also had the "The Commodore" off the drink menu, and it was very good, too. The drinks are a little pricey here, and they will set you back around $11 or $12 each.

When our friends arrived, we were seated outside and I got to try to village burger and the short-rib and cheddar duck-fat fries. The burger, which comes with an artfully restrained dollop of homemade thousand island dressing, was unbelievable. The applewood bacon and the dressing served the elevate the already-incredible taste of the meat. I can't wait to come back and order another one. As for the fries, they were very good, but I think next time I will stick with the plain duck fat fries. Our friends ordered those, and they were super crispy and delicious.

Warning: this place gets insanely busy, so you might have to wait a pretty long time for a table. 

All in all, the drinks were great, the food was delectable, and the staff was very knowledgeable and personable. I would totally come back.

Still dreaming of that burger,
Chris M.

We stayed at The Saint last year for a girl's trip. The lobby is lovely, they have a cool bar and restaurant that you can't help but to "ohh and ahh" over when you walk in.  All the things I'm accustomed too when I stay at a hotel anywhere...ambiance, a little sexy but not overkill! Everyone is so friendly, etc.  I'm thinking "oh shhhh this is going to be a great weekend!"  I checked in a few hours before my girl arrived because I had a ton of work i needed to do. So I set up my laptop ordered some room service and worked for about 4 hours straight. Left out to buy a bottle and get a mani/pedi.  My girl arrives...its about to be some trouble in NOLA... the two of us and no supervision...we pop out for dinner, come back in giggling as usual and we see it...a HUGH flying roach.  I'm freaked out.  I literally walk right out of the room down to the front desk.  I CANNOT!!!! They tell me they're sending a maintenance worker to handle it.  NOT GOOD ENOUGH! If there's one that's bold enough to show itself, he has other cohorts that prefer to live behind the scenes. They give us another room but tell me they can't do more until 8am.  No the room the move us too also has small spiders and other dead small bugs in the corners of the window. The TV doesn't work and one of the lamps doesn't have bulbs in it! COME ON!  At this point its about 3am and I know I'm not staying here past 8:15am. I dont want to sit my purse let alone my luggage in this hotel! I go online to my normal go to hotel, The W and book us there for the rest of the trip! 8am comes and goes no manager comes to our room. I go down and demand to see someone immediately.  This younger gentlemen comes out and apologizes.  I thank him for his apology and politely request ALL of my money back immediately.   He obliged and asked if  I would consider coming back after changes have been made! Bless his heart. NO dear!
--------------------
I really wanted to like this place and heard about it during lent when I had given up meat. I found myself in the area again and decided to give it a try. I usually don't write reviews until I've been to a place a few times but I think my experience was a complete one. I ordered the special and sampled each type of chicken, the modern BBQ sauce, mac&cheese (which the woman behind the counter was very proud of), 
a bananas foster pie, and the new hope birch beer. After finishing everything, I just wanted my $16.20 back. Individual reviews: 

The chicken: It was very average and that is being generous. It wasn't incredibly flavorful but it wasn't dry so it could have been worse. 

The sauce: It had the tang of a traditional North Carolina BBQ sauce, mustard and vinegar based. I can't eat mayo so I was limited with sauce choices but the mayo sauces were recommended. 

The mac&cheese: Salty and mediocre. It combines all of the things I like but makes a mess doing it. The pasta was well cooked but the cheese and bacon combo made it taste like I just licked salt off of my hand without the nice shot of tequila after. 

The bananas foster pie: The crust of the pie needs no improvement but the filling could use an overhaul. I use the term filling loosely because after biting into the flakey crust, I struggled to find the bananas. There was a thin layer of smashed bananas and cinnamon sugar at the bottom and 75% of the interior was empty space. 

The new hope soda: The birch beer (the actual name of the soda escapes me at the moment but it is birch beer) was the highlight of my meal. Everything you would expect from a Pennsylvania birch beer and very refreshing, which surprised me because I normally don't like fountain sodas and prefer root beer.

I gave this place 2 stars instead of 1 because nothing was horrible.  I think the concept works, the decor is nice, and the menu is good but they need to work on the quality of their food because it currently doesn't match the cost.
--------------------
I tried to like this place... I really did. So much so that I went back to try it after a less that satisfactory first wax.

Wax 1- I had Despina, I think her name was. I waited a good 15 minutes after my appointment time for her to come and get me from the front. Ironic they have a 9 minute policy that if you don't show they'll cancel/charge you or whatever. Anyway, as for the experience with Despina, she did not speak to me. Like at all. Made me feel super awkward the whole time, and missed a fair few chunks of hair. She didn't ask me anything about myself, didn't tell me where to sit or how she wanted me positioned etc. Luckily I got this one half price as it was my first time at EWC.

Wax 2- I booked 3-4 weeks later with Amy Jo (based on previous Yelp reviews). She was a lot friendlier (literally the only reason why I'm giving this 1 star) BUT way too sloppy. I think it's safe to say this is the worst wax I've ever had. She left half of my hair on right before Valentine's Day! I understand they can't get all the hairs all the time but a lottttt of hair right on top was left clearly visible to my waxer. My apt was at 3.45, I walked out of the building at 3.53. Really. This includes the time spent undressing, redressing, and paying. 8 minutes is not long enough for all of this. It went so quick that when she said she was done I was actually shocked.  
I'm about to go to CVS and get some at home wax strips to finish the job... For $47+ I expect way way more. 

The staff- Another reason why I won't be returning. The ladies at the front desk are generally rude and disinterested in showing any glimpse of good customer service. ALSO, I don't like being asked if I'm going to tip - can't you give me the card machine so I can do it myself rather than make me announce if I would like to tip and how much? 

The hunt for a decent Brazilian wax in Philly continues- someone help me PLEASE!

oh Millers, how i wanted to like you.  You are close to my house, have ample parking, and large spacious tables.  you even have a fireplace in the back for a little ambiance. 

friends and i tried to come here 2 or 3 times for a quick/inexpensive* bite to eat and every time there was a 30-60 minute wait. we thought this must mean they are really good.  perhaps it just means that people in Springfield are willing to settle for a less than average dining experience.  *side note- this place is not inexpensive. 

hubby and i ordered apps- he got zinger boneless wings, and i got the guacamole. portion size was ENORMOUS on the guac - it could have served 8 people, seriously.  flavor was meh. apparently the wingz were good.  hard to tell what hubby enjoyed more, the wingz or the scantily dressed hostesses. 

our server was great, attentive and pleasant.  When something went wrong she did her best to fix it. That was much appreciated.   Side salad came out wilted and gross. management offered to take it off the check, would have rather had a decent salad in the first place but i digress.  Dinner was not very flavorful - at all - and portion sizes were okay. i got the quesadilla appetizer (which was plenty for an entree) but it was very sloppily put together and had no seasoning at all.  I have had food that is presented better and tastes better at fast food restaurants, where i am happy to pay $5 for a meal.  

At the end of the meal, i badly wanted dessert but didnt want to risk another poorly flavored dish.  Not to mention, all the dishes were like lunch tray plastic, and i felt that a $50-60 dinner for two was at least worth a nicer presentation. who knows, it may have even made up for the bland flavors. 

perhaps i was let down by the fact that there always seemed to be a wait and i had over hyped it in my head.  Never have i wanted to send back everything i ordered at a restaurant before this night.  i will never be back.  my husband says he will order the wings, but takeout only. no more dining in at this place.

Trying to find a restaurant in The Big Easy that serves vegetarian is not an "Easy" feat

We've encountered many the restaurant who would tell us time & time again that they did not have or *would* not make something to accommodate veggie needs & it was such a letdown.....to this day I still remember 1 guy saying "Vegetarian?  Aww, you gotta get out earrrrrly for *that*".  We still laugh about it....

Well, over the last few years, we're noticing more & more places recognizing veggies like to eat Southern / Cajun comfort food & they are starting to open up their menus to us! ( YAY)

Seeing that Muriel's Jackson Square had such an offering, we made rezzies to ensure we veggies got fed - you'll want to do this too - veggie or not!  They were packed & quoting 2 hr waits & this was at 9pm!

Started w/ drinkys at the bar - Sazerac for the Mr & I had the uber-delish Honey Child cocktail: honey-infused vodka & muddled blackberries.  The Mr liked mine so well that he ordered 1 too, to go w/ dinner & just to be nice, I had another as well so he wouldn't have to drink alone

Their veggie appie had eggplant, of which I'm not a fan so we asked the waitress if they could make their Goat Cheese Crepe, veggie & she said sure.  Since the description said it was topped w/ crawfish, we thought, this would be easy..... but unfortunately, the roulade sauce was made seafood stock. ACK!  Wished you had told us this!  The Mr however, said the crepe was nice & plump, the goat cheese was creamy & smooth & he liked it, barring the sauce

Mains consisted of their Veggie Soiree - this was a sampling of little dollops of veggie tastes - some you'll find on their side dish offerings & some not

Divine beets & roasted acorn squash

Polenta topped w/ chickpeas & a basil sauce - flavorful though those beans were crunchy & could have used a bit more time in the cooker.... same w/ the crunchy wild rice

Yams were very flavorful & had lots of ginger - the Mr got to indulge in both our dollops of chard - I tried a bite & it triggered my dislike for cooked greens

Too full for dessert, we left w/ happy tummies & thankfulness for a nice veggie night out.  A-OK night!

Wow!  I just wrote a scathing review about El Patron Pizza in Tampa for leaving unwanted and unwelcome fliers under the door of unsuspecting tourist here in Tampa.  I was going to use a lot of the same issues for this review of New York Pizza Grill, but now I'm not sure what to say, only to say it carefully.  I knew there was something not quite right about the greasy looking punk that was meandering in the hallway of the 4 star hotel where I am currently residing.  As soon as I saw the flier I grabbed my room key and went looking for this person.  In hindsight that was not smart, as soon as I got a look at the guy, I ran for the elevator.  Now, I am no shrinking violet, but this guy looked like he's slap his own mother.  After reading the other reviews on here, I guess I should be happy that this employee didn't turn around and attack!  My biggest issue with this business is that they litter the halls and rooms with these fliers.  They sneak into hotels, a place where you feel safe and after this, I don't.  It doesn't seem to matter where it is a 5 star hotel chain or a family run business.  I did call every one of the pizza place that do this, because I felt bad about complaining to the staff at the hotel, but after yesterdays run in with greasy guy for New York Pizza Grill, I had it.  I do not feel safe and I told management that, and the did call the police.  So, for the employee of New York Pizza Grill, if you get caught stuffing fliers under doors where you are not invited and do not belong, you are more than likely going to be arrested.  So when you are out and about making not enough to keep your car running, ask yourself if your boss will bail you out of jail.  I doubt it, they'll probably just get another less than intelligent person to litter, trespass, annoy and sometimes terrify, hotel staff and their guests.  There are numerous reasons not to eat at New York Pizza Grill, but I'm just tossing out a good reason not to work for them.

Terrace Lounge appears to want to have a great cocktail venue, but they fall short.  One bartender didn't even know there was a new cocktail menu.  The cocktail was weak and watery, and the liquors they have here and throughout Peppermill are the most unfortunate corporate types.  The service is also very spotty.  It confounded me how four bartenders could not seem to handle about 45 customers.  They didn't have any bar areas, so they all floated around the circle, but then they'd stop, often just short of me and go to the waitress stations to fill their orders.  You can't really build up any rapport with four bartenders floating around trying to serve everyone.  I also hated the people there.  Sorry, but many were your run-of-the-mill casino gamblers.  Why don't you just sit at a machine and play?  You didn't come here for the drinks or to smooze with the bartenders, so seriously, go sit at a machine.  One just sat next to me and lite up a cancer stick and the smoke just blew in my face.  Look, if I walk into a bar and sit next to someone, it's their turf.  They can smoke, fart, vomit on themselves, if I don't like it I can leave.  But if I'm there, it's my turf.  Don't come sit next to me and smoke, fart, or vomit all over yourself.  Or at least be frickin thoughtful and if you see your smoke wafting in my face, put your cancer stick and tray on the other side of the bar so it wafts in your face.  Oh, you don't like smoke in your face???  Me neither moron.  Your life revovles around throwing away your pension money in a mindless electronic game of cards and killing yourself with carcinogens and toxins, well go kill yourself in private, seriously.  You don't see me walking up to a bar and slitting my wrists and burning my money.  It's gross.  I probably just realized this, but I really enjoy Cin Cin not only because they have the best cocktails in town, but they have no machines at the bar.  Peppermill, if you want to create a cool cocktail bar, ditch the machines, train your staff, or hire bartenders with better service skills, and buy some independent liquors.
--------------------
This place is hip.  Perhaps too hip for many over 35 but if you can tolerate the boisterous and extremely casually attired youth--I haven't worn a suit in 20 years either but even 20 year olds should have something besides skinny jeans and T-shirts with borderline obscene slogans in their closets--the food is worth it and the staff copes well.   

I had a 6:00 reservation (obtained the day before) but the sky seemed threatening a downpour so I came early to avoid it and was seated 20 minutes or so before the appointed time.  I often don't even make reservations and have no trouble getting seated at popular places by being there when they open or, for those open all day, coming before the popular dinner hour, but that didn't work the day before at Lüke.  Even at 4:30 the place was packed so I did make one for the following day.

My meal started with the crispy Brussel Sprouts.  Even if you hate Brussels sprouts (I like them), don't be afraid to try this dish--if no one told you you might not know what you were eating.  They are in some sort of sweet/sour sauce/dressing and fried both slightly blackened and crispy as advertised . . . tossed with almond slices, small bits of jalapeño and sprinkled with shavings of cheese on top.

Then I had pork schnitzel and "pommes frites" (that's shoestring fries to the Galliphobes).  It came with whitish gravy in a pitcher, I suppose to make it "Southern".  The gravy was good but I skipped eating it, doing that the usual way with a squeeze of lemon.  It was excellent and the fries were fine too.

I finished with some excellent decaf and a glass of Kahlua--I had had iced tea with the meal so some alcohol was not an excess.

A lady who was some sort of hostess dropped by my table while I was eating to make sure everything was OK and when told I needed ketchup (for the fries), went and got me some (in a dainty little single-serve Heinz bottle).  My waiter also checked several times but didn't hover.

I am giving it 4 stars.  The 5th star is withheld because of the crowded dining room and noise level . . . nothing to do with the food which I greatly enjoyed.
--------------------
Let me preface by saying that I have been getting my hair cut by a guy in Austin for seven years, even though I've lived in other cities for half that time. He is that good. The couple of times that I've strayed, I have been severely disappointed in the outcome. But I wasn't planning a trip back to Austin for a while and badly needed a cut, so I decided to bite the bullet.

My friend walks in a few weeks ago with *srsly* the cutest short hair cut. And so I ask her who and where, and she says Rodney Mitchell. I figured that this place would be too expensive, but she corrected my thinking on the matter. So I called to make an appointment with her guy (whose name I sadly cannot remember at the moment) and Rodney answered the phone. Turns out the guy my friend had seen didn't do morning appointments and all my afternoons were filled, so Rodney said "look, I'm the owner, I can absolutely vouch for Allison who has several openings in the next few days." So I thought, alright, he's the owner so he knows his stuff--I'll do it.

Allison absolutely did not disappoint. First off, she's a total sweetheart, but not super chatty (I appreciate stylists who can be content to both hold and not hold a convo while working) so there was no pressure there. I came in with my laptop and several photos I'd found that approximated what I wanted in a haircut, as I couldn't find exactly the right one. We talked about it a bit, discussed front and back length, bangs, etc. and she said alright and went to it. What she gave me was the cutest damn shaggy bob that I never thought possible. I seriously can't wait to go back.

One of the other awesome things about RMS is that they give you a discount for your first visit and I believe they have some kind of discount for students and teachers. They also will give you *another* discount when you refer people. So I got my friend a discount, and then referred a friend, so I'll get another discount when I go back for my next cut. All good things when you're trying your best to be a frugal  grad student.

I find it hard to believe there are so many people with such low standards when it comes to the Daily Bread.

It is a ripoff of St. Louis Bread Co/Panera Bread, which in of itself I don't mind at all.  I have eaten multiple times at the Daily Bread and have yet to have an enjoyable experience.  The food is so-so at best.  Their sandwiches are basic and lack any real flavor.  I also tried the BBQ Chicken pizza and it was okay.  

I certainly wouldn't steer anyone away from this place based on the food.  The food is basic and simple, not bad but also nothing great.

My biggest qualm with the Daily Bread is the service.  The majority of the workers seem utterly uninterested in helping out.  There was a line of about 6 people and one person at the register.  There was no sense of urgency to help any of the customers in line.  We waited for a good 5-6 minutes to put an order in.  After receiving our cups to get our drinks we looked for a clean place to sit and eventually settled on a table top that was the least dirty of the tables available.  There were plenty of open spots but it just appeared as though there was lots of trash left behind.  Does anyone bus these tables?

I anticipate that people are responsible for cleaning up after themselves, but it appeared as though the tables hadn't been effectively cleaned in a while.  There was also some trash on the floor that hadn't been addressed as well.

The order number was called and the order was only halfway completed.  When we asked which sandwich was ours, we were basically ignored as the girl put up two more orders.   After another few minutes the rest of the order came up and we began to eat.  I tried both items and as I stated before, both were okay.  The problem is that the food was just unable to make up for the lack of organization, the slow speed at which we were served, or the cleanliness of the restaurant.

After 3 attempts, I'm writing the Daily Bread off and won't return.  I'd rather go to St. Louis Bread Co, get the same level of food, but in a clean environment and a timely setting.

The gym part of City Fitness is better than most, good equipment, clean, variety, it's a nice gym. I find the rates reasonable and have been a member since they opened and will continue to be a member. So, for the rating I give the gym at CF a 3.5 star, I give MBSC a 1.5 star for an overall 2.5 star rating.

MBSC review: I thought I would kick it up a notch so joined the MBSC thrive program at CF on South Street and tried it for three months. Trainers really aren't "personal" trainers. They have a set program that they put people through and you have very little to say about what you like/don't like. The trainers work with several people in a session so depending on how many people are in a session you could be waiting for the trainer to get back to you or waiting for the person in front of you to finish. One of the things that frustrated me is they want you to push through the routine they have come up for you in the hour's time. The sessions are hard with ropes, sleds, balls, bands, cables, weights and the most uncomfortable stationary bike I've ever had to sit on (and they make you end every session on the thing). No two sessions are alike - so if you like variety then great, if you like consistency or at least enough repetition to get the moves and form down then not so great. I seldom found a session to be fun or enjoyable, rather I often felt like I was a contestant on the Biggest Loser. They also play hip-hop all day long and you either like it or you don't. The environment and training is designed (in my opinion) to appeal to 20-30yo demographic.

If you really want to push yourself beyond your limits and don't care how you get there then you might really enjoy the MBSC program. If you want a professional personal trainer to spend quality time with you in achieving your goals and if you want a training program that you actually learn what muscle groups you are working and not just to be pushed through a routine then you probably won't like MBSC. Definitely do a introductory program because the usual 30 day notice from the contract date applies if you cancel and it's $200+/mo program.

I love trying fresh seafood on piers, wharfs and seaside markets. Most of the time, it is a disappointing experience but this place is not. The food is legitimately fresh and prepared well. The gorgeous view is just a cherry on top of nature's beautiful sundae. I have been here before but ordered the "wrong" thing (cioppino). That wasn't very good when I had it a couple of years ago here. 

We came for a late lunch/early dinner on a Monday. Even at 4pm,  there was a wait! We waited about 25 minutes and got a table outdoor. While it wasn't ideal that we sat right in the sun with no shelter other than our sunscreen and sunglasses, the view was worth it. 

We got the local crab special which was a steamed 3-lb. crab served with a salad and soup for $26. I thought this was quite the steal because the crab was huge, delicious and meaty. The garden salad was fresh as simple as it was. The lobster bisque we got was pretty good. (The other options were Caesar salad and clam chowder). They topped off the crab with a couple of onion rings and cups of cocktail sauce and drawn butter. Yum!

We also got the fried platter of shrimp, oysters, calamari and scallops for $12.95. It came with cole slaw, onion rings, tartar sauce and cocktail sauce. As greasy of a meal as this made, it was one of the better fried platters I've had anywhere. The seafood was just really fresh including the sometimes-feared fried oyster. :)

The ice in our iced teas melted away in the sun. Our waitress was so cool and brought us lots of extra ice and an extra iced tea in case we needed it (we did because it was hot out!). She was just friendly and good at her job - five stars for her!

By the time we left at about 6, there were so many people waiting. Make sure you sign up for a seat on the clipboard right when you get there. The restaurant is the last one at the very end of the pier. Parking on the pier is free for 90 minutes but it looks like a drive that will upset tires. I parked in the large lot south of the pier and walked 15 minutes up and onto the pier. It was free on a Monday late afternoon.
--------------------
First impression:

Home Wine Kitchen's "No Menu Monday" is a must-try for anyone interested in the St. Louis fine dining scene or good food more generally.  We came prepared with reservations, but the restaurant actually began quieting out while our delicious meal was ramping up; the tables offer more elbow room than the photographs online belie.  As the name of the evening suggests, no menu is in play here; you'll let your friendly server know if you have any food allergies or particular preferences, and before long watch your customized meal unfold.  That's a three-course meal, $30, plus $12 for three half-glass wine pairings.

As starters, we were served lamb meatballs -- likely the favorite of the night -- and goat cheese-stuffed poblano peppers.  The peppers had a good bit of spice offset by the chalkiness of the goat cheese, making an excellent pairing for my Soave (white wine).  The mains were a corvina fish delicately cooked in wax paper and a swordfish steak served over asparagus with homegrown tomatoes and "love sauce."  The corvina came out on the rarer side, perhaps a little too complex for this Midwesterner's palate, but the hearty swordfish was some of the best seafood I've tasted in Missouri.  Dessert comprised a champagne gelatin and a chocolate tart, both of which were topped by fluffy homemade whipped cream and quickly eaten.

The staff at Home Wine Kitchen made our visit pleasant, acting casual yet professional during our meal.  The restaurant patrons seemed to be largely industry types that oohed and aahed about the cuisine (perhaps a trifle self-importantly, but this Yelper is no saint himself).  I was surprised to note that other diners were served the same courses as we were (albeit in different configurations), when I was under the assumption there would be a little more variation; however, I can only imagine the challenge such an endeavor would pose to the talented kitchen.  The interior, lighting, and volume here were all very good.

By the end of the evening, we realized that putting yourself in the hands of the chef is not for the faint of heart, as evidenced by one conversation near us during the meal that all but stopped when a beautiful whole fish was served to the table.  Leaving the restaurant, I was glad that I had tried No Menu Monday, but did wonder what the meal would have been like had I ordered off the menu.  I guess that calls for a return visit, don't you?

This review is LONG overdue!  I visited Stitch-It in June 2013

In brief: Stitch it did an EXCELLENT job on my dress and I was extremely pleased.  I needed it done in a rush and they were able to accommodate me.  Given the tight turnaround, and the work that needed to be done, I didn't mind paying a premium.  The service and results far exceeded my expectations.

Complete Experience: I was attending a convention in Nashville, TN and had ordered an evening gown online a week before (admitted procrastinator tendencies).  The gown was a navy blue Tadashi Shoji evening gown with sequins and an intricately designed lace and sheer layered bodice. The gown was a tad bit too long and there was a bulge in the back. The dress arrived a few days before I was scheduled to fly out to Nashville and I knew I wouldn't have time to get it tailored before leaving.  I found a few Nashville area tailor shops on Yelp, read the reviews and decided I might try Stitch-It.  I also saw a few cleaners that advertised they performed tailoring services, but they (quite frankly) didn't give me the warm and fuzzies.  

Stitch-It was about a 30 minute drive from the Gaylord Hotel where I was staying, so before taking a taxi that far, I decided to check with the hotel to see if they had an in-house tailor.  When I took the dress to the Gaylord tailor/seamstress (who was the nicest lady ever), she looked at the gown and said "I can hem the bottom....I'd have to do it by hand.  The top part though....I won't touch that with a 10ft. pole!"  I laughed, but appreciated her honesty in not being able to handle the work that I needed done.  

I contacted Stitch-It and sent pictures of the dress via text message to a nice young man who's name I can't remember (I think it was Cameron...I could be wrong).  They assured me that they should be able to accommodate me, so I hopped a cab and visited Stitch-It.  When I arrived I was greeted by courteous and professional staff.  I was shown to the dressing room and changed into my gown.  My personal tailor was Maggie O'Neill and she was AWESOME!  After the fitting and pinning, I left the gown and picked it up in two days.  It fit perfectly and was well worth the fee.  If I lived in Nashville, I would DEFINITELY use Stitch-It on a regular basis.
--------------------
I've been driving by this location for several weeks anticipating their opening.  With the established Legends Sports Bar directly across the street I thought this place must have something very special to feel they can compete.

They took over the building that was prevriously used by the Ruby River Steakhouse.  The owners apparently opted not to change a thing about the indoor seating.  Gone are all the cowboy boots, up are various team jerseys. It looks like somebody went to Pro Image at the mall to decorate the place.  Nothing appears to be autographed or evoke a sense of authenticity.

Video games are available for the kids, so bring your quarters.  No dart boards, shuffleboard, air hockey or pool tables.  This is pretty much a dine and drink only establishment.

More TV's in the place than I could count (I figure at least 20), all tuned to ESPN or ESPN2.  No clue at this time if they are choosing to use Direct TV, Dish, or Cable One for their service.  However, they already have made one of the biggest mistakes I think most wannabe sports bars make; they broadcast music rather than sound from a live sporting event.  With live sporting events available almost everyday from 12pm - 12am, you would think they would want to try to emphasize that rather than muzak (tuned to a country station; still feels like the Ruby River).

A word of advice here, if you want people to stay and eat and drink, you gotta give them something on which to focus their attention.  The sounds of the game will get their attention.  They came to a sports bar to think about sports, not Conway Twitty.

Typically, when I see the word pub in a restaurant name, I think it is just beer and wine, but it looks like Timeout has a full bar with several specialty drinks.  With a designated driver, it may be fun to experiment.

The food is typical sports bar fare; salads, burgers, pasta.  Most items will cost $9 - $11, with entrees running more.  A few twists on their offerings will ensure that I stop in to try something different, but unless the atmosphere improves, I think I will always leave a little disappointed. 

Those staying at the nearby motel may like the proximity, but I think they might find the walk across the street to Legends worth the extra steps.

Happy Hour 2pm - 6pm Monday -  Friday; Late Happy Hour 10pm - close Monday - Thursday.  Happy Hour all day Sunday.

We used The Hollander Hotel for our wedding hotel and it was an absolutely incredible experience.  I will never get tired of raving about our experience.  We were honored to use the Hollander not only for our room block and wedding night suite, but we also used the Tap Room as our after-party location and we hosted a brunch for our guests on the beautiful patio on Sunday morning after the wedding.  Everything was perfection and if we could do it all over again, we wouldn't change a thing!

The hotel property is absolutely charming.  The décor in the lobby is beautiful, eclectic, and very welcoming.  The Tap Room is a great place for people to gather with intimate booths and large tables for bigger parties.  The Bar has an amazing selection of local and craft beers and the servers and bartenders are all professional and fast! We were able to use the Lobby and Tap Room for some of our wedding photographs too, and they all look wonderful!

The rooms are very pleasant and quaint and our guests all complimented on how clean and cozy they were.  The prices were also wonderful and our guests were able to enjoy downtown St. Pete because of the great location.  The shuttle is also very convenient and a great experience for guests!

The brunch was perfect.  Not only was the price great for an all-you-can-enjoy feast, but the food is delicious and homemade.  The wonderful gentleman who makes the omelets is friendly, fast, and takes great pride in his work.  He is also a talented baker and I couldn't get enough of the chocolate muffins he made!  The service at the new coffee/dessert café was wonderful!  The Patio was a great place to visit with our guests and enjoy the beautiful St. Pete weather. We look forward to many more brunches there in the future! 

Finally, the best part of all is the management and team at the Hollander.  Nick and Will treated us like their own family.  They went above and beyond to ensure that each of our guests felt like they were at home and comfortable.  Zach at the front desk was so friendly and patient with me as I called checking on our room block.  The entire team was just a delight and so very accommodating.  They take great pride in ensuring that every guest has a wonderful experience.  We just adore everyone there!  I absolutely loved working with them and would recommend this beautiful hotel to anyone!
--------------------
The only reason I didn't give this restaurant a 5 star rating, is because of one single pretentious waiter. As a 4 night guest at Hotel Palomar, the location of the restaurant is an obvious plus. The first night of my stay, I met a coworker in the restaurant for a cocktail. When we arrived, the host staff were busy and not available, so we just walked in. The restaurant was not too busy, so we just looked at a small table next to the bar and proceeded to take a seat. A waiter came by and I quickly asked if we could have a seat, before sitting down and told him we'd only be having cocktails. He stumbled on his reply, and in an irritated/in-convinced tone, told me "I guess it would be fine" and basically just kept walking mid sentence. My guest and I brushed it off, and started having a conversation while looking at the drink menu. To make a long story short, he was distant and we both got the "couldn't be bothered" vibe from him. When it came to the bill, we asked if it could be split due to company transaction policies, and you would have thought asked him for some inconceivable task. We basically spent the rest of our night and elevator ride to our room in shock of the rudeness we had just experienced. 

Although that situation left a bad taste in our mouth, and the night before we decided to avoid the restaurant, we decided to grab another cocktail and give this place one more try. After looking around and ensuring "last nights waiter" wasn't on shift, we walked over to the bar and started looking over the menu. Instantly, the bartender greeted us with pleasant small talk and made us feel 100% welcome. He asked about our day, recommended cocktails and was a completely genuine person. This guy (I think his name was Ben) is an absolute star! He gave us lessons on Whiskey, described how to make classic cocktails, and was 100% invested in our experience. This is exactly what a bartender at a 4/5 star establishment should be - actually he exceeds that. He was kind, funny, friendly and completely redeemed this restaurant/bar from our terrible experience the night before. 
I also ordered room service last night from this restaurant, and it was amazing. The bacon wrapped dates and chocolate cake are to die for! Great restaurant and amazing bartender(s). Too bad one bad egg could have spoiled this experience.
--------------------
Don't judge a book by it's cover.  Looked like a any similar bar food type chain like Friday's, Bennigan's, or Ruby Tuesdays... JB Dawson's is far better.
Awesome experience from the second we stepped in, hostess greeted us with a smile and time to table waiting expectation.  We were promptly seated, and tended to right away with a smile and good attitude by a server, Nancy, who helped us with a beverage and app order.  

For our app we shared the twisted shrimp as it was Twisted Tuesday.  Nancy told us this dish far surpassed Bone Fish's Bang Bang Shrimp, to our surprise, it clearly did.  Our beverage and app shortly followed. 

Shortly there after another server stopped by, Kyle, who was our designated server.  Boy, smile, great greeting, great attitude, engaging.  We talked a bit, figured our way through the menu and placed our order.

For our dishes, my wife selected the Four Cheese Mac & Cheese side -- Sharp Cheddar, Pepperjack, Mozzarella & Reggiano dusted with bread crumbs with cornbread as she had large lunch.  Very good.  Unexpected, light, not overly creamy, not burnt, just right.  And the corn bread with maple butter..... ahhhhhh that was really nice.

 I ordered the fish tacos-- 3 Flour tortillas, seasoned tilapia, chimichurri sauce, mango cilantro salsa & a lime cream drizzle.  Passed on starch sides and had their asparagus that was cooked to perfection.  To my surprise the they were filling, nice size portion (see photo)  not a two bite app.  Very moist and super fresh fish.

Great first experience all around expect one key aspect.  Their so called craft beer menu was really limited and did not contain a variety of types; focused more on IPAs.  Limited thinking for the bar manager I must say.  Kyle our waiter also bar-tends.  We got to talking and he offered with no questions to swap out my beer for another option --- Stoudts Scarlet, which is a reddish beer.  For my beer palette it was better then the others limited options had a nice taste at the swallow then waned off.   Kyle informed us that they buy for all 4 restaurants and try to find a middling that works across the 4 guest demographics.  Not a great decision honestly.  There are so many great craft brewers in the Bucks County region and even Bristol area that should be showed cased and tested through.  For me a bad or poor beer selection stunts the overall experience.

We'll be back but I may need to sneak in my own beer selections from my craft collection.
--------------------
The plan was to find a one-of-a-kind engagement ring. I had no prior history or knowledge of jewelry, especially not engagement rings. Foolishly I visited a handful of those cookie cutter mall shops. Boring. Pricey. Nothing special. Blah.

A co-worker told me about Gemological Resources Inc (GRI) and the wonderful experience he and his now wife had with them. Since it was a local shop I gave them a shot not knowing what to expect. Wow.... What a great experience! 

From the moment we (my girlfriend and I) walked into GRI, it felt right. We met with Terry initially to get a feel for GRI's work, as well as to discuss ring options.Terry is an encyclopedia of knowledge; it was a true lesson on everything we needed to know about diamonds, rings, etc. Very much worth taking the time to meet with him. He not only shared much of his knowledge, but also listened and got a good feel for what my girlfriend liked. The initial meet was a success and I felt confident that GRI would be the right place to go once I was ready to make the decisive move solo.

When the time came I met up with GRI again, this time with Nirali who works closely with Terry. Because I wanted a unique, special, one-of-a-kind engagement ring I decided on a custom design ring. The CAD images and designs were perfect! To top it off, Nirali found me a high quality and very well priced diamond; this after I spent weeks personally searching for the right diamond. I was sold!! 

A reasonable deposit and a couple of weeks later the ring was finally in. Wow oh wow!! It was perfect! 100X better than anything I've seen before. GRI knocked it out of the park! Seriously! Fast forward a few months later.... My wife loves her ring and goes goo goo over it everyday. We had our bands done by GRI as well and they too are perfect (the wife's band was also custom designed to match the engagement ring).

All in all it was a GREAT outcome. We are both so very pleased and happy about our experience with GRI. Beyond our expectations. Never have I had such a relaxing and pleasant experience. I truly mean it. It always felt like I was meeting with friends and not just a standard business transaction. 

So do yourself a favor... If you're reading this it's because you're thinking about buying jewelry. Save yourself the hassle. GO DIRECTLY TO GRI. I highly recommend them.

I don't know this for sure, but my first impression of this place is that it is run by unscrupulous people. Come along with me, as I journey back in time -- all the way back to Wednesday...

I step foot in this 7 Eleven, and the first thing I think is: this is one of the nicest looking 7 Elevens I've ever seen. It is very clean, bright, and spacious. Very nice looking selection of prepared meals. There were many that actually looked like they'd be quite good. But I wasn't hungry this day. No. All I needed were a few items. 

First, some good old TP. And let me be perfectly clear (as clear as Barack Obama): I DON'T buy the cheapest toilet paper because I'm cheap. I buy it because I like the way the cheap stuff feels. The more like sandpaper, the better. I like to feel like its working. I don't need to or even want to feel like an angel is up there. Or some perverted freak named Scott. 

In any case, I got myself 4 rolls. And then I just needed one more thing - some plastic cups for a little party I'm having this weekend. 

I go ahead and drop my stash on the counter, begin to extract several singles from my wallet, when the cashier looks at me and says, "24.99."

I respond, "That's not right."

He points at a price tag on the plastic cups which reads 19.99. I begin laughing. I tell him the price is clearly wrong. He tells me he's got to talk to his manager. Meanwhile, I tell the folks behind me waiting in line that I'm just going to go run and get different plastic cups to hurry the process along. Before he got back from doing his price check, I already had another cashier ringing up my two sleeves of cups for 1.99 each. That's more like it.

At around that same moment, the first cashier comes back from his consultation with his manager. He tells me that the price was, in fact, incorrect. And that the price is actually 14.99.

THAT'S the unscrupulous part.

CLEARLY, THAT price is also far too high. His manager did no actual price check at all. He simply told the cashier to pretend that the real price was actually 5 dollars less, thinking that I'd be stupid enough to accept this. Why, because I'm white, and you're a racially superior Indian? You think white people are stupid don't you? We'll just believe what you tell us, and fork over our money.
--------------------
I moved from Chicago to Philadelphia over a year ago.  Everybody here raves about the restaurants, but I have yet to find many that deserve five stars, or even four.  This is the best restaurant I have eaten in in Philadelphia.  

Tahini and bread  arrived at the table, and I thought, hum, plain but I'm hungry.  They must put crack in that Tahini.  I wanted to lap it out of the bowl like an uncouth dog.  The bread is excellent too.

I love a menu with many organic meat choices.  How often can you order an organic beef shishkabob?  It was superb.  The meat done perfectly, the onions nearly caramelized but not quite so they still had some substantive crunch.  The purslane salad tasted like I was eating a plant in the middle of a garden.  It is not often that I dream about a salad but I do dream about this one

My husband had a chicken dish with black eyed peas and green peas and fantastic rice.  I won't begin to describe the flavoring; it is beyond my culinary vocabulary.  We asked what spices they use, and in addition to traditional zatar, they use their own blend of spices.  I don't even need to know what is in it just so long as we can keep coming back and ordering it again and again.

I was so full but ate dessert none the less, which I usually don't do.  But when a diner is this good, I had a feeling the desserts would be too and I just needed to find out.  Pistachio creme brulee.  It could have come out over the top, but no indeed.  It was pure pistachio heaven in s super light yet rich custard.  Heaven. Heaven.

Our service was superb.  The squeezed us into a last minute Friday night reservation with the caveat that we would need to get through our dinner in an hour and 15 minutes in order to accommodate a reservation made prior to us.  Given the time constraints they never made us feel rushed and timed the meal perfectly.  Then my husband left to go to the restroom, the waiter picked up his napkin and refolded it nicely on the table.  Do I care about the napkin placement in the middle of a meal?  Not really, but it is a sign that the waitstaff is incredibly attentive and extremely well trained.  

My eating out plan for Philly might just be to skip eating most everywhere most of the time so I can frequent this expensive, though appropriately priced restaurant.  Kudos to the chef.

Awefull!!!! 
If I could give zero or negative stars I would!
I've never wrote a review before, but I am going out of my way to say that I had the absolute worst dining experience at the Sake House!! 
And esp families, stay clear! 
So first off, I decided to take my 15 month old son out on a sushi date. We arrive at the Sake House at 4pm. There is only one other table and they were closing out. We sit down, and I immediately ask for a simple ice water with lemon. Waiter comes back 20 minutes later (no water). I order a simple roll for my son, to get him started  and a cold Sake. I said I will wait to order mine to get him settled. Another 30 min later, still no water, no food. Waiter comes back with hot Sake, instead of cold. 20 minutes later, the roll for my son (not how I asked) finally some cold Sake, then I have to request water, and then only one cup for my son, no lemon. When I see 2 going on a third table had come in and ordered, and a "to go" order is being placed, all with food and water, I became perturbed. The waiter never came back to see what I wanted. Never came back to check on the order. Finally after  nearly 2 hours of waiting and trying to deal with my antsy son, who waited so long to be served, and seeing one chef trying to make everyone's order I decided it was time to go. Finally after waiting another 5/10 minutes I had to walk up and ask for my check , which was only a $6 drink. Which I reluctantly paid. After being in the hospitality industry for years, I know what to expect, and I know what to forgive. I also know that English being a second language must be tough...BUT since he was able to wait in other tables i know that wasn't the issue. After 2 hours of waiting, and dealing with a fussy/hungry toddler as a single mother I feel like the least they could have done is offer a free drink, to say "we understand we couldn't accommodate you, but we tried." It's principal above all else. ...I just waisted 2 hours! And had to leave and take my baby somewhere else. Time is money! And I waisted 2 hours here! 
Time that is rare and I had to plan being a busy mother.
I should have listened to the other reviews about the shitty service here. 
Don't waste your time or money!!!
Stay away! Any other place is better than here!
--------------------
Wow what a terrible spa. I can only speak for the manicure/pedicure aspect because I did not get a massage. Typically, you go to a spa to escape and relax - you can not do that here. It is small, dirty, and the staff is terrible. 

I walked in and the receptionist was on the phone - he did acknowledge that I was standing there, but several staff walked by and did not offer to assist. Finally, after two other guests came in behind me, someone came up and took me back - just to get me out of the way. Asked what my name was and left. Did not offer me water/refreshments of any kind. I've had better reception at the local nail salon. Then I had to wait for 10-15 minutes for my technician to finish up her current client, which I didn't mind because I leisurely picked out my color. When it was my turn, the nail technician was shaky and rushed. She cut my cuticle and I bled. She was sick and kept blowing her nose into her shirt (gross!!) and took time outs to really blow/dig in her nose with a tissue right in front of me! Lady, you are touching my hands with yours, you are blowing bacteria into the air, if you are that sick don't come to work - *Management, if your employee is that sick do not make them come in! You will lose clients. 

She gave me the worst hand/arm massage I have ever had (that is usually everyone's favorite part, and the technician's opportunity to shine!). No pressure was applied, and she just basically rubbed lotion into my skin and made a snarky comment about how my skin was so dry is was just "drinking up all the lotion." Yes, I realize it's dry, probably due to the 20 degree weather and wind outside, but thank you for making me feel self-conscious. 

When I went to leave the receptionist was on the phone again, but did actually put them on hold to get me out of there. I opted to put everything on my room charge, which resulted in extra fees but I didn't care. There was a blaring sign saying how they preferred cash gratuity and that there would be extra fees associated with putting services on your room. Yes, everyone prefers cash gratuity - but how tacky can you be?!! 

Overall, it was an extremely disappointing experience. I have been wanting to stay at the Monteleone for years and made it a priority to experience their salon. My gel nail polish is already chipping and it hasn't even been a week. Spa Aria definitely needs a overhaul and I would recommend you go anywhere else but here.

3 separate reviews:

CITY TOUR: 1 STAR -Not worth the time or money. We never got a confirmation email when booking over the phone. Then during the tour we had to wait and be hassled over payment that was already cleared on our account. Don't do this tour if you get carsick easily. It was full and we had to sit in the back. You can't see anything on the tour through the tinted windows and you only stop at two places that I never would have stopped at on my own. 

The only intriguing part was the Katrina history during the visit the the 9th ward. Do yourself a favor and take the green street cars, save your money and REALLY see things on your own time. We couldn't get pictures of anything and wish we would have done a walking tour instead or tried the red bus tours.

PLANTATION TOUR: 5 STARS! Our driver Stacie gave us a history of the surrounding area and a lot of cool information on our way to the plantation. Laura Creole plantation had an amazing history. Our guide there was Ethan and he did a really good job explaining about the owners journey to this land and how the slaves were treated and also their journey. We felt that it was a balanced historical view of the plantation in general. After that tour we went to the Oak Alley plantation. The grounds alone are worth the trip. The tour guides really focus on the landowners and not so much on the lives of the slaves living there. But you have some time after the tour to visit the  slave quarters on your own. But we wished that there would have been a more balanced explanation of both experiences like at the Laura Plantation. The buses are big and you can recline and take a nap on your way back to the hotel. (No car sickness) 

SWAMP TOUR: 4 STARS and we didn't even see any alligators! This would have been a five-star tour if we would have seen alligators. But our guide Henry was very thorough and explained a lot of great details about the surrounding area. We got to see some boars, raccoons, and birds. It started to rain with thunder and lightning so we did not see any alligators because we had to go back for safety reasons. We did try to see some alligators but they don't come out if it's cold. Don't book your tour if it's cold or storming and I'm sure it will be a 5 star tour for you.  The buses are big and you can recline and take a nap on your way back to the hotel. (No car sickness)

After today's lunch, Iris has moved to the top of my New Orleans favorites lists--no small feat in a city where restaurants are numerous and culinary competition is fierce. Iris excels in every area: food, drinks, service, atmosphere, location, music and overall graciousness. I made the reservation for 10-15 people, not knowing exactly how many in my party would show up. Iris pulled out all the stops to make sure everyone had comfortable seating and even prepared an overflow table for us. At no time did we feel jostled or rushed, which is a common fine dining concern. 

The layout of the restaurant allowed diners to move freely to and from the table and to exchange seats as needed. The music selection was fun and unique, ranging from the Magnetic Fields to Johnny Cash. It was also quiet enough to be enjoyed while allowing conversation to flow unimpeded. Our waiter had excellent timing and anticipated our every need. 

Though they don't have a full drink menu for lunch (I hear they have an amazing mixologist for the dinner hour) they do offer a selection of martinis and wines. One of the guests has accounts with several high-end bars in the Quarter, and the drink list passed his muster. Our table settled for Chardonnays, Perseco and chilled shots of Chartreuse, though I hear they have several types of absinthe as well. 

Our group began with slices of warm, heavenly bread that Iris bakes in house. We continued with an assortment of salads--I had the Hollygrove arugula with warm goat cheese, niçoise olives and balsamic vinaigrette. It was fresh perfection. A few of us opted for the mussels, which I heard were delicious. For my main course, I had a wonderful drum with onions prepared in a tangy soy reduction, which was an elegant complement for the fish. I also heard rave reviews about the gnocci and chicken. 

All the entrees were creatively arranged and selected, and at no point did I feel overwhelmed or that any fuss or pretense had gone into the food. I also appreciated that the portions were European-sized (it always makes me laugh when other Americans list too-small portion size as a complaint even when the food is well-prepared!). Iris prepares a lot of their basic ingredients in-house, and I appreciate that the kitchen makes a point of incorporating gulf fish and produce purchased from local, farmer-friendly markets. 

We settled on the prix fixe menu, which was $20 a person for appetizer, main course and the dessert of the day (the best strawberry sorbet I have had yet). With the added drinks and tip it came out to under $35 a person, which is an excellent price for such a delicious white-linen lunch. No matter the size of my group, I will definitely be returning!
--------------------
If I could give this place zero stars, I would. I had the worst experience when we went today for brunch that I've ever had in a restaurant since I moved to Tucson 7 years ago! First, before even going today, I called to find out what the brunch entailed and when Rosie answered the phone I told her that I had a few questions about brunch, she told me to hold and never came back to the phone. I stayed on hold for 8 minutes at which I called back and spoke to someone else who just seemed like "Oh Well." This brunch was organized by one of my friends, so choice in location was not something I had. We did have a reservation, but were pushed outside because apparently they only planned for one 8 person table and the other table got there a few moments before us and got to choose. The problem with this is that there were two people in our group that are allergic to bees, myself being one of them, and bees were flying all around our table, especially our food. At one point I had to get away from my seat and was not able to return to it for 5 minutes because the one been landed on my waffle and was not leaving. 

At this point my friend and I recognized the danger for the two of us and asked to be moved inside to which we were told "No." When I asked to speak with a manager, I was told "Well, what did you want?" That's when the manager came up, I explained the situation and he was going to put us at one table to which our waitress, gotten by the hostess came up and said to him "I already to her that they could not move in here." What employee talks like that to their boss! The waitress proceeded to run outside and tell the rest of the group that we were moving at which point they decided to stay outside, which was fine by my friend and I, but that meant having to be separated from our friends. This, to me, is deplorable behavior on the side of the the waitress and management. The waitress who was supposed to be our waitress inside as well, never arrived to the table and never checked up on us. Needless to say, I had to get another waiter and he was so appalled with the way that everything was handled he told my friend to not give him a tip. I was so appalled myself, that I did not eat because I just did not want to spend my hard earn money at this establishment any longer. I would never recommend this place to anyone even if they were starving!
--------------------
This review is mainly chicken talk as Cuenelli's Peruvian Style Rotisserie Chicken brings to the table. Pollo a la brasa.... Rotisserie chicken.... Whatever you wanna call it.... I call it a technique done here with love and pride. Lets be clear, you will find no comparison coming from your grocer deli section or at the checkout isle.

Why do I think this chicken have some TLC put into it? On biting down of this chicken you can note seasoning flavors down to the bone. This is an inclination that prior to even getting into the rotisserie oven, these birds spend some time in some form of marinating process. Building flavor, the chicken also has a seasoning rub all over the skin.

Lets go to this rotisserie oven. Another unique element is this oven has a charcoal or grill like component. This gives the chicken a smoky element in the flavor build. As these birds turn in this oven, they keep moist from the natural drippings dropping from bird to bird as they rotate through this oven. In turn, this a reason why some people may note some pieces the skin end up dry and crispy and others get moist or soggy skin on their chicken In the end, you end up with this tender, smoky, well seasoned, fall off the bone goodness. Wait.... how can they add more flavor? Cuenelli's serves it with two dipping sauces, a chimichurri  which gives a herbaceous and slightly spicy flavor, and an aioli which has a garlicky - lemony element.

Round out this meal with some solid sides. Must haves for me would be the cilantro rice. Another herbaceous addition that works well with this meal. I got to use the word herbaceous a few times in this review, it has reflects such great imagery for food talk:) Must have beans with rice no? I pick the spicy pinto beans over the black beans at this establishment but lets be clear these beans are pretty spicy. I also love the maduros here. These sweet plantatains are cooked to perfection where the outsides has this caramelization from the natural sugar of the sweet plantain, leaving you with this toffee-like, stick to your tooth exterior and soft and sweet interior. 

Wash all down with Inca cola or a bottle of chicha limena.  Inca cola is almost like a cola champagne or a cream soda type of drink. Chicha Limena I say is Christmas in a bottle. This juice has a floral base blended with cinnamon and cloves.

Though Cuenelli's Peruvian Style Rotisserie Chicken have many other notable Latin dishes, the one thing that comes to mind to me is this chicken made with love. This chicken gives new meaning to all who thought they knew what rotisserie chicken is. I say, go to Cuenelli's and taste again for the very first time.

--------DINNER REVIEW----------

I rarely write reviews, but this honestly was one of the worst group dining experiences I've ever had. It was objectively a horrible experience, even without comparing it to the hype it receives, and ruined what was supposed to be a nice birthday dinner celebration. 

We had a group of 8 that had a reservation made well in advance. Short wait, but not too bad. Keep in mind, it seemed like a normal Friday night, but weren't super busy or at-capacity.

It was a birthday dinner, so I told the hostesses that it was her birthday, and asked if they could bring out something for her at the end of the meal, which was acknowledged. Pretty standard stuff, whether at a Applebee's or the French Laundry. We were sat at a booth right next to the Maitre D' stand, and next to all the wait staff's home base, so pretty much no excuse for not getting any attention. 

After getting us waters, it took them a LONG time to even come by and acknowledge us. After ordering wine, it took them another good 15-20 minutes to even bring us our wine, and no one even checked in on us! (hint: if you're running a restaurant, wine is your profit center and doesn't take any work other than taking a bottle off a shelf and opening it. bring it out ASAP...). 

After ordering food, it was more of the same...a long wait for food to start coming out and no one checking in on us AT ALL. We drank the bottles we ordered and had to get up and flag someone down to get another wine order. A couple of us even got up during the meal to remind them to bring out something for birthday girl at the end of the meal. 

Once our meal was done and taken away, we were given dessert menus and the server disappeared for 10-15 minutes... AGAIN. After coming back, he asked what dessert we wanted, so we ordered some coffees... and waited... and waited. Eventually we got up and asked him what was going on and if they were going to bring anything out like we asked multiple times. 

They finally brought out a couple of cookies with a candle...

In summary, the food was pretty hit or miss, pretty mediocre for this price point. Whipped feta, like other reviews have said, was amazing, and the Braised Lamb was really good. But the Sirloin was chewy and bland and the Grilled Caesar tasted like a soggy, luke-warm, wilted mess (two orders were left untouched by a group of 8). Atmosphere was nice and trendy. But the service, which is a huge reason to spend your hard-earned $ at a restaurant, was absolutely horrendous. 

I really love going to cool, popular restaurants and having a great time, and I hate writing such a negative review, but I had to share my experience, especially for a restaurant that is getting an awful lot of (undeserved) hype.
--------------------
This hotel is a gem in the heart of Philadelphia.

It's a cozy, quaint, and charming property. The rooms are spacious, modern and gorgeous. 
The decor is chic and attractive: big wooden desk, hardwood floors, couches and throw pillows: Looks more like a friend's apartment than a hotel. 

Free breakfast is always a plus for those of us with limited time. It's not a hot breakfast (I've had so many mass-produced bad ones, so I'm not complaining) but greek yogurt, a huge croissant, an orange and some cranberry juice hits the spot! They leave it at your door though, instead of ringing your bell to wake you. So if you ask for it to be delivered at 7 a.m., check outside your door; by 7:01 it WILL be there. 

Coffee, a variety of teas, cold and hot water, as well as ice and a bowl of assorted fruit are available 24/7 in the lobby. There are doorbells for each room, and the hotel can only be accessed after hours if you have a key card. Floors are acessible with a keycard as well, for extra protection. The staff is very polite: one of the few places in Philly where someone will actually say "good morning" to you (No, seriously. I lived there for 5 years, so trust me on that). They're also extremely helpful. When I checked in the night before, the gentleman at the reservation desk called to make sure I had a cab waiting for me at 8:15 the next morning so that I could make my speaking engagement on time. While I was getting my clothes ready, my iron was making more wrinkles than it was taking out, so I asked them for a new one and within 30 seconds, I had a brand new model with all the bells and whistles.

I've read a few reviews talking about the noise level of this place. My room was closest to the reception desk and I never heard a peep. There were people out and about, but I didn't hear a thing. And I'm a very light sleeper...

A few things to note:
Its location on a tight, one way street can cause a little difficulty if you're traveling solo, but if you have one person to unload the car while someone else parks, you should be fine. The parking garage they use is about half a block from the hotel, but you have to drive in a big rectangle to get there. 

There's a stand-up shower instead of the traditional bathtub/shower combo. It fits one comfortably enough... provided that you're not too far from average height and build. (My boyfriend is 6'2 with a football player build and he made out okay.)

Don't expect much of a view. The view from our room was of the side of another building. But that's what the city is for... go out there and see something!

Overall, this was an excellent trip and a great find. I highly recommend this hotel to anyone.
--------------------
We were thoroughly impressed with this hotel! Upon arriving, you are immediately welcomed with the scent of fresh baked cookies. Walking up to the desk we were greeted by Valorie who informed us that cookies and water were complementary to guests and that we were more than welcome. Across from the desk we noticed a book shelf. This is not the kind of book shelf where rejected leftovers were placed but rather, a wide range of books by well known authors. The name of the program was called Read it and Return. In essence, you can borrow a book for the duration of your stay and if you don't finish it you can return it the next time you stay at the hotel at any of the Carlson hotels who have the same program! ( what!?! Cookies and books!?! YES!) Right off the bat, we felt like we were right at home.

   Arriving at our room, we noticed that everything was extremely clean and there was a refrigerator (with a small freezer) , a microwave, a coffee maker, and a well working A.C. (you know, the kind that you don't have to yell over to have a conversation). The bathroom was stocked with brand name shampoo, conditioner, and lotion.

  Our next stop was the smoking area. Normally, smokers feel as though they have been marooned to a small place behind the dumpster...but not here! Provided was 2 sets of swinging benches; set far enough away so that it did not disturb the guests in rooms around the area but no a 10 mile hike for those adults who enjoy the pleasure. Did I also mention they have smoking rooms available?

In the morning, feel free to partake in a complimentary breakfast (NOT CONTINENTAL)-I mean a real breakfast which changes daily; anything from fresh made waffles to eggs, sausage, and bacon! Also, cold cereal, juices, and coffees have options! Coffee is available 24/7 as well! 

The hotel also has a pool and hot tub which I personally observed them clean daily!

On our last night we got back late and I was going to ask the desk for a late check out, but there was no need! Their check out time is 12:00 Pm as opposed to the hotel usual of 11:00 Am. That worked out well for us.

At checkout we were asked if there was anything we would change about the hotel or our stay. I made small suggestions which I thought would help them, but definitely nothing major. The desk person wrote down what I said and said she would pass it on! I was impressed with that, because we've been asked about our stay at other places, but it seemed more out of routine than actual interest. Here, she seemed genuinely interested. We don't usually do reviews, so I'm sorry for the long review. However, we wanted you to get a real feel for this wonderful hotel and hope that you enjoy it as much as we did! Thanks for reading and safe travels. J & Niki.

If you are looking to be impressed by French-German dishes in New Orleans, please go to Luke Restaurant, I know I was. 

The restaurant is located in the Central Business District, next to the Hilton and in the former Masonic Temple Building, so there is that historic vibe to the restaurant. The front room is a lot more grand than the back room (where we were seated), but that is offset by views of the open kitchen. 

Apparently they only want to seat people with reservations, so since we did not have one, we were refused seating until 9:15pm (it was 6:45pm) but with a little back and forth, we ended up waiting only 15 minutes before we were seated. However, as we walked through the restaurant to the back room, way too many tables were empty that it made no sense that they acted that way. A lot of tables still remained empty throughout the meal.

I decided to start out my meal with a cocktail. I originally wanted the Mint Julep but they were out so I had the Riverbend (vodka, lemon juice, basil syrup, blueberries & ginger ale) at the recommendation of the server. It was a relatively sweet cocktail, with the ginger ale being the most powering flavor, but you could still taste the alcohol.

My friend choose a regular starter and ordered a cup of the Crawfish Bisque. She ate all of it so I am assuming she liked it, but she did complain of a sour aftertaste.

My boyfriend skipped the appetizers and went straight for the entree. He always seems to find the most basic item on the menu and order it. He had the Luke Burger (bacon, caramelized onions, tomatoes, Swiss cheese) and was raving about it. One thing I can tell you, it was a very good size. 

My friend had the Jumbo Louisiana Shrimp "En Cocotte" with lump crab meat, roasted jalapeño cheese grits, andouille & green onion sausages. She loved it.

I have an obsession with mussels so I had the classic Moules et Frites. Although only having two simply ingredients (garlic & thyme) in the broth, the flavors stood out and the taste was a lot bolder than others I have had with a lot more ingredients. The house-made fries were scrumptious. These are the best kind.

Even with all that food, we still made room for dessert. We first had the Bread Pudding which was delicious but quite sweet. I am also not a fan of over sauced foods.

One wasn't enough so we also ordered the Bourbon Vanilla Bean Creme Brulee. It was superb and not too sweet which is a plus for me. The little cookies on top added nothing to the dessert and if anything could have been left off.

All that good food, I still have to give props to our server. He was amazing and engaging. The front desk soured the mood a little bit a first but he more than made up for it. I couldn't have asked for anyone better.

I first found out about this adorable little salon here on yelp while looking for a place to get a manicure downtown/ CBD.  I visited on 3/8/13 and got their "Mini Manicure"- it's only $15!  I chose an OPI polish and the nail technician did a GREAT job!  So great in fact, that today on Monday, 3/18/13- I did not have ONE CHIP!  This is amazing for polish!  My nails looked fabulous!  The technician was friendly, as were the other stylists.  I'm not sure if it was the manager or the owner that was working the front desk- but she came over as well and was super friendly and welcoming.  The salon looks amazing, trendy, and peaceful.  It has a great vibe.

I was so happy with my first appointment- that I went back today, and left disappointed.  I went to the same nail techinician- and we talked as she worked on my nails.  The person working the front desk (seemed like an owner/ manager- although different from my first visit) was SO  nice, welcoming, and talkative.  This time though I needed a gel manicure, in french- as I am in a wedding this weekend.  I explained that I was in the wedding, assuming the technician would know that this more special than just an everyday manicure  The technician stated after she started my nails, that she did not have the proper brush that she needed in order to do the manicure.  So like most places- they paint the white, and then go back later with a brush to create the crisp, perfect line.  Since she did not have the brush to do that- she used a q- tip.  So obviously the lines are not perfect or even.  Along with the lines being uneven- some are thicker than others, and the edges go up, instead of down.  My nails are not at all filed and shaped pretty either.  For $40 (+ a tip)- I really expect them to look right.  I went during my lunch hour, and it was supposed to be 30 minute appointment, but the appointment took a little bit over an hour.  I understand that french takes a little extra time- but this seemed like quite a bit extra.  I was late for work, and had to hurry out of there when she was finished and did not want to be even more late to work to stay there to make a complaint.  I wish I would have- but I also felt bad because the technician was trying so hard- but they are just not up to par.

I'm conflicted, but I don't know that I'll return.  I loved it to so much the first time, I even sent friends over there.  But after this time- I am not happy with the product.  I wish it wasn't gel- because I can't even take the polish off myself.  So I'm forced to have nails that I am unhappy with, or go to somewhere else and pay to have this taken off, and then pay to have them re done- all before a 6am flight on Wednesday morning, and it's Monday afternoon....
--------------------
My boyfriend and I both decided to try Jesse's for the first time after we'd both grown up in the Brandon area and neither of us had ever been, and really hadn't heard much about the restaurant. 

We dined on a Saturday night and even though the parking lot and restaurant was packed, we were sat right away at a 2-top next to a window facing SR-60. 

Our server, Nikki, greeted us in a reasonable amount of time. We ordered our beverages and she brought them shortly after that. Something I did not like was there was not a drink menu on the table, but Nikki was able to tell us what beers were on draft and non-alcoholic drinks. She took our appetizer and entree order all at once. 

We ordered crab stuffed mushrooms and a French onion soup to share. These items came out together. The crab stuffed mushroom was basically a giant thing of crab stuffing on a TINY mushroom, which was almost laughable, but had a good flavor nonetheless. The French onion soup had a great flavor and wasn't scalding hot, which was super nice to eat right away. 

After our appetizer came out and we finished it, our Caesar salads came out as well as a loaf of bread and some butter. This was also really great pacing of our meal! Nikki never let empty plates sit on our table, was very attentive, and always made sure we had drinks in front of us. The Caesar salads were good. I gave the bread two chances... once dipped in the French onion soup and once just with butter on it... the bread could have definitely been better - it just didn't have a good flavor to it. 

I ordered the 6 oz filet and he ordered the 16 oz Delmonico - both cooked medium rare. The steaks are served with sautéed mushrooms, your choice of side, and a salad or soup of the day, which isn't mentioned anywhere on the menu. I got broccoli as my side and my boyfriend got a sweet potato with all the fixings. I saw three tables sat after us receive their entrees before us - I don't know if it was a kitchen issue or something else, but we were sat at least five minutes before each of those tables - I tried to make sense of the delay, but it honestly wasn't a big deal to me. Our steaks came out on hot metal plates that were inserted into a cooler outer shell. My filet was nice and thick and cooked perfectly and the broccoli was steamed very tenderly, but there were not enough sautéed mushrooms on the plate, in my opinion. If I had known it would have been like five mushrooms with the steak, I totally would have gotten them as a side. My boyfriend's steak was cooked perfectly as well, but being on the hot metal dish led the steak to cook more at the table, which he wasn't particularly pleased with. He enjoyed his sweet potato with butter, but it didn't come out with cinnamon on it like he requested. 

Anyway, I am sure we will return! Our server, Nikki, was fabulous. She was extremely attentive, had a great attitude, and was knowledgeable!

The long and the short of it: A romantic little BYOB in Newtown Square that hits the mark in several areas. Big portions at decent prices. You won't leave hungry!

And now for a full review:

I have been to this Fellini's Cafe and the one in Bryn Mawr several times and each time I've visited there have been some memorable moments...and there have been speed bumps that keep this place from reaching its full potential.

On my latest visit this past Friday night, I made reservations for 730. My beautiful wife and I arrived right at 730. Although there were two vacant tables available, it took them at least 10 minutes or so to seat us. And when they did, they broke up a table for 6 instead of putting us at the 2 seater. Odd.

Being out and away from the kids for a few hours, we wanted at least a little bit of privacy, instead of sitting next to (pretty much connected to) a table of four. We asked the manager if we could be moved to the 2 seater...he said fine. Another 5-10 minutes (too long!) later a member of the wait staff came and, without any indication as to his intentions, whisked up our bottle of wine and silverware and ran off to the other table. Not a problem, but some eye contact and a simple 'follow me please' with even a hint of a smile would have been lovely. We shrugged and just rolled with it.

The interior is quaint, and the lighting is dim. It's a nice place for a romantic meal. But it is LOUD. So loud I would say this place is kid friendly despite being in such close quarters with your neighbors. Not sure if we'd ever try taking our four kids there (actually I'm certain we won't) but one or two can be done without much trouble.

Our waitress was extremely polite and offered the energy and enthusiasm that our other friend lacked.

For dinner, we ordered a caesar salad to share and for our main courses my wife opted for her usual tagliatelli with mushroom cream sauce and i had what i always have, the tortellini pasticiatti.

Complimentary with the meal were two pieces of bruschetta (very nice) and a small loaf of crusty Italian bread, which is served with butter packets (which perhaps only I find strange for an Italian restaurant?). 

Overall the food was delicious, except for a few somewhat minor hiccups: 

1. The caesar salad was served on a warm plate. The salad was excellent and would have been legendary had it been served on a chilled (or at least not warm!) plate.

2. I am pretty sure they used frozen peas in the tortellini dish, which is fine with me as long as you make sure the peas are thawed before you serve it! Only a few peas were not quite thawed, but it marred what was otherwise a perfectly crafted masterpiece of a dish.

When we paid, the manager allowed us to use an expired gift card. That was a very nice gesture and one that required no push from us to induce.

All in all, I'll keep visiting Fellini because it's relatively inexpensive and they do most everything well.
--------------------
Too big, too expensive and too far from Downtown.  

I was here for a conference, which seemed like an awesome idea. It wasn't.  I'm in Direct Sales and (like most people at this conference) don't have tons of extra money to spend on mediocre meals when I'm traveling.  $10 for a slice of generic pizza, small side salad and a soda for lunch.   I understand it's a hotel but there weren't any options close by.  Just getting your car from valet was a hassle and took a lot of time.  Being such a big property, it made getting to restaurants off the property really time intensive.  Since you're so far out of Nashville (out near the airport), the good little holes you find when you're in a city are pretty nonexistent.  

The property itself was great.  The hotel is HUGE but really pretty.  I enjoyed walking around but was really happy when I found what I didn't know existed...a shortcut between my room and the Convention Center.  It took my 10-15 minute walk down to about 3 minutes!  BONUS!  Like I said, this place is ginormous.  

Room: Our room was great.  I shared a wonderful suite in the Garden Conservatory with 2 other girls.  We were under a group rate and my friend was quoted $200/night, which is awesome for the space we had.  We had a large room (probably used as a hospitality suite for groups) for socializing.  It had a great bar area set-up and a nice big fridge and lots of drawer space.  Our bedroom was separated by doors that could be locked from either side (like an adjoining room), so it looked like the hospitality suite could be reserved without reserving the room.  It was different than what I was expecting, but whatevs.  It was fine.  So, I wasn't there at check-in.  The girl who reserved the room checked in a couple days earlier than my friend and I.  So, Sunday comes, and the bill was waiting for us when we woke up.  Our friend was charged $1200 for one room (I'm guessing the suite) and $1400 for the other room.  YEP.  She reserved what she thought was a 2 room suite for $200.  The bedroom door was closed when she got there and she asked them to open it up. It was all arranged by the bellman.  She was never told that the bedroom wasn't included....kind of necessary if you're staying over for 6 nights, dontcha think???  So, she's being charged $2600 for what was supposed to be $1200.  Last I heard, the Gaylord's legal department was investigating what she was told, what she wasn't told and if they should charge her the entire amount.  

Checkout:  A FREAKING NIGHTMARE.  Between the money situation, which was not resolved as of late this week, and the 45 minute wait for a cart (in a hotel that holds thousands of people, you'd think they'd be plentiful and they aren't) and a 25 minute wait for the car, my friend and I decided to sweat it out and schlep our goods to the door where our car would be delivered to us.  It was not a short walk and we had a TON of stuff, which meant multiple trips.  UGH.

I'm sure I'll be back for another conference (I am pretty sure my company has booked this for at least one more year....) but I'm not going to be happy about it.  I might even consider driving down, staying in a hotel somewhere downtown and driving out to the Conference stuff.
--------------------
I am so glad we had our wedding here!!! I cannot say enough what a pleasure it was to work with Breanna, the venue manager and Eli, the food and beverage director. Our wedding here was a destination wedding, so we were very concerned about making sure all of our family and friends that travelled a long way to get to our wedding had a good time. Being a couple straight out of grad school, we were also very concerned with keeping the cost manageable. Everything worked out on all accounts! 

We first picked the venue for two reasons: the price was right and the venue is GORGEOUS. The pricing was very straightforward, which we really appreciated, and when looking at other options in the Santa Barbara area, the Riviera mansion was pretty comparable with other venues which are not all inclusive (ones where you have to find your own caterer, rent linens, etc etc). Planning a wedding without a coordinator and from across the country, it was also definitely worth it for us to go with a venue that minimized the amount of details we would have to think about.

The looks and layout of the place are what sold us though. With people coming from the east coast and middle of the country, we wanted something that would really showcase Santa Barbara's cool architecture and vibe. The mansion is exactly that.  The layout is also pretty perfect for a multigenerational wedding. We were able to enjoy the California weather for our ceremony and cocktail hour outside, then go inside for dinner, avoiding the cooler night air. Later, we could turn up the party in the bar/dance floor area, while the older folks talked and relaxed on the couches in the living room. It really has something for everyone.

What I didn't realize when we picked it was how absolutely awesome all the staff would be to work with. Breanna was super helpful, answering all my questions promptly and pleasantly, and accommodating my sometimes short notice visits to the area. When we did our walkthrough a couple of days before the wedding, Breanna and Eli paid attention to every detail and made sure we were taken care of, as they did the day of the wedding too. Eli was incredibly attentive and easy to work with! My dad is in the restaurant industry and was in charge of setting up desserts (we had family make some traditional desserts, as well as got some cupcakes from Enjoy Cupcakes- also a great idea!). Eli worked with him to get whatever he needed, risers, tablecloths, etc and was really sweet about it. 

The attention to bartending at the Riviera Mansion deserves a paragraph of its own. Breanna worked with me and the bartender (who's name I forget but has worked there for 20 years and is also incredibly awesome) to create a peach moscow mule as our signature drink (our colors were peach and green) and get it to taste just right. She even arranged it so we had fresh peaches! At the wedding, everyone raved about them, even guests who usually prefer something more manly sounding. The staff had all drinks ready to go for our cocktail hour, and also passed trays of drinks, so there was never a line at the bar (something guests also specifically mentioned that they appreciated). Hell, Eli even followed me with my drink for a couple of minutes around dinner since my hands were full of other things! Really spectacular and attentive service.

Five stars all around. It was absolutely a joy to have our wedding here.
--------------------
If you are in a hurry and don't have time to read my entire review, here's the bottom line:  this place is FANTASTIC!

After my 3 month old car got rear ended TWICE inside of TWO weeks at the end of October, I took my dealership's recommendation and ended up bringing it in to Prestigious for repairs.  I am really glad I chose them.

First off their place is really clean and professional, you feel more like you are in a bank or a business office than a body shop.  I don't mind the typical "shop" feel of most of these places, but the experience at Prestigious is a notch above that and I appreciated it.

Next off, they assigned a specific advisor, Juan Mendez to work with me from start to finish through my repair.  He was really knowledgeable and provided detailed information to me about how they were going to diagnose everything and ensure that all of the various components of the damage were fixed correctly.  There was an added challenge in my case because I was hit in nearly the same place by two different drivers:  one submitted a claim through insurance and the other asked to pay outside of insurance.  I explained all of this to Juan and he came up with a forensically defensible way to determine the value of the damage caused by each of the accidents so that the costs could be assessed fairly and accurately.

Juan set up my rental for me and kept me updated regularly throughout the repair process, which in my case took a while due to the insurance company requiring additional evaluations etc. and the Thanksgiving holiday.  Detailed updates, and the fact that these came to me without me having to ask for them, made it a lot less stressful during the time my car was in the shop.  Juan (and I believe all the other staff who hold similar positions over there) also clearly understands all of the procedures, and deviations that can occur from these procedures, that are related to processing insurance claims and he was always able to answer any questions I had.

I got the vehicle back yesterday and the quality of the work is 1st class.  There is no way to tell that anything ever happened to the back of my car...it looks exactly as it did when I purchased it in late July.  I was particularly concerned about paint matching because all of the exterior damage was to the bumper (a plastic part) which had to be matched to the car body panels (metal parts).  Anyone who knows anything about paint and body work knows that it is a challenge to match paints on different substrates, and most body shops, even Prestigious, have disclaimers about this that are plainly visible in their offices.  I told them up front I was really concerned about this, and they said not to worry.  They were right....they did a dead-perfect color match in my case.  I have mild OCD and I notice even the smallest differences and defects in things, and I was 100% satisfied with the paint match, as well as the gap tolerances etc. on my repair.  If a place can meet my standards, it is going to far surpass most people's standards.

It sucked to get hit twice in two weeks, in a brand new car....but I am thrilled that I found this place as part of the deal.  I would take my vehicles here from now on and recommend them to anyone who wants a top quality job with serious attention paid to fit and finish.
--------------------
I would NOT recommend this place to anyone. Their biggest mistake is not having a customer service department. They rely on their sales team to provide customer service meaning every time you call in to try and get something done, you get put into a voicemail because the sales guy is out selling - which should be their only job. This left me on numerous occassions incredibly frustrated that I could not get an answer. I even left the manager a voicemail (big surprise I couldn't get them to answer) and they never had the decency to call me back - Just made my sales person call me back.

I purchased my car last July and was promised numerous things would be done to the car before I purchased it. One of which being the tint on the rear window would be removed as the view out of the back was blurry. Somehow, that passed thru inspection and when I came to sign the papers, I noticed that it was still on the back windshield. I was told that they would have it removed by the time we were done the paperwork. Also, I was told that the price was going to be higher than the original agreement because the sales manager did the math wrong the previous day when we ran numbers. I told him that wasn't my fault and I would only pay the agreed upon amount and he spoke with the manager and got it sorted out. 

After sitting in the office for 2.5 hours, they finally told me that they were unable to even start taking off the tint and I would have to bring the car back. I dropped it off that Friday and let them keep it for the weekend. My sales guy called me on Saturday night to tell me that they never got to finish it and I would have to bring it back again and leave it. I live 45 minutes from the dealership so this isn't something I can easily do. I insisted on them giving me a loaner car for whatever day they would do this as I was sure this wouldn't be a one day process from my previous experience. 2.5 weeks later they were able to provide me with said car and I dropped off my vehicle. When I went to pick up my "finished car" there was still tint left on the bottom of the windshield. 

After all of that I knew I would never bring my car back for service there if that's the kind of service they provide. Now with all the rain we've been having, my trunk is leaking and when I called to check with the service department to see if it would be covered under warranty, I got the same run around with the service department who just said "I don't know" - OK well give me someone who will be able to tell me. Once they forwarded me to the correct person, I again got "I don't know". We need you to bring it in and look at it then submit to our warranty company to see if it gets accepted. No thanks after my previous experience of bringing my car in there to get "serviced". 

Invest in a customer service department to handle complaints in a professional and timely matter. This should not in any way be left upon the sales department to do. My sales guy did the best he could and I appreciated the help he gave me, but no one else would help me throughout the entire process. Not a good look on managements part.
--------------------
After a long hiatus from reviewing I have awaken from my 6 mouth yelp hibernation and my tummies a grumbles with an insatiable hunger for the cacophonous symphony of flavor that is Indian food. Like an all too familiar pattern, I go back to Mohammad Butt, my main man for marsala.
But whats this? 
There are whispers that he no longer cooks for "Best Taste of Asia," that he is gone, never to return; some sort of falling out.

No.
No, it can't be! 
I need to score - one .. final .. hit..

Life ceases to have meaning, existential murmurings dog the mind. Who am I?
Why am I here?
What is Cheeze Wiz?
Its done, over, a round falls into the chamber and just as I prepare to end it all and pull the trigger- steps in ZAIKA.

Zaika - meaning the art of taste -  stays to to its name. This is a place where the Paneer (cheese) is made fresh in house, resulting in a cheese that's silky in texture. Especially when in contrast to the prepackaged rubbery bone-white LEGO blocks most small Indo-Pak places purchase from Indian Grocers in attempts to reduce prep-times. While at Zaika such shortcuts are not taken,  the Chef takes the extra steps needed to ensure a dish comes together as a whole. For example, the Chicken Makhani uses Smokey Tandoori Chicken, which I have never seen done before but it certainly aids the chicken to cut though the rich buttery tomato sauce and elevates the dish as a whole. Even entrées like Dall Fray or  Palak Paneer  have so much flavor that they will leave you not missing animal protein in the least should you choose to go the vegetarian route. 

Zaika 's appetizers, like the Veggie Samosa and Aloo Tikki, (spiced potato patties) are generally large, peppery and well spiced - the latter of which remind me of something my own mother would make. Though I must warn others to avoid the items that occasionally pop-up as specials like the potato stuffed chili peppers, unless they have a iron stomach or are a gluten for punishment. These peppers are spicy, not deveined or even seeded. Further, I find the fish pakora to be far too fishy.
 
I've become rather taken by Zaikia. Even the simply things such as the naan are good there. Just right in elasticity, the bread does not have too much give and yet isn't too soft. It's nothing elaborate, just properly risen with a light texture and  no egg or yeast flavor. The only complaint being that it lacked that signature faint sweetness naan has. But hey, I use it mostly for mopping up the other good stuff on the plate anyway and the sweetness gets lost in the mix, so I don't mind at all.

The menu has nearly 120 different items, all numbered to order by, making take-out phone orders convenient and should eliminate any fears anyone should have of a language barrier problem. Furthermore, it has short descriptions of each dish - something all ethnic places like this should have.
Though some items like Lassie (a frothy yogurt drink) do not appear on the menu, that too is offered - both a salty and sweet mango verities. 
The head chef speaks English quite well and should be easy to deal with should you want to inquire more or want to setup large orders.

I have already noticed parties negotiating catering for Ramadan as I anxiously awaited my own order.

The bottom line here is this, Mohammad Butt has expanded on the menu he once created for "Best taste of Asia," and taken an all HALAL meat approach. 

Only good things can come of this, only good things.

P.S.
ZAIKA is right behind Nifty Fifties on Grant Ave., so you are all set for dessert should you want a milkshake. 
However, I would suggest getting the Ras Malai if available. These riccotta cheese dumplings flouting in soaked in sweetened, thickened milk are delicately flavored with cardamom, a very some amount of rose water and then garnished with pistachios. They are ungodly good.
--------------------
4-5 stars, this is just after one visit so far, worth a try if you're a thai fan. I liked the food, but you always have to have the first visit to see "how they do things" and figure out what your preferences will need to be.

I did use their living social deal so I brought my dad in when he came in from out of town to try it out with me. I like the set up, the quaint house is cute (and well, quaint), but I can see how it wouldn't be ideal it if was jam packed. I imagine you could potentially do family style for some of the pub height tabletops. I did call ahead to make sure that I didn't need to print out the coupon and it could be used from my ipod and to make sure they were open, as the website said to just double check.

We started with shrimp spring rolls, probably the best I've had, the ingredients seemed fresher, and crispier. No shredded lettuce here. Simple and loosely wrapped, but you could taste the individual components. The peanut sauce was tasty too, though they don't have sirracha (spelling?) to add to it, just dried pepper flakes. 

We then got the tom yum (gai?) with shrimp. I know it is hot (because of the name, duh), I usually prefer it a little less spicy (I am white), though I still got a good sour flavor (for instance at Thai chili it's too hot for me, I don't taste any sour). I usually get my tom yum without meat or seafood because I feel the meat gets dried out, but the server assured me the shrimp wouldn't be overcooked, and they weren't. I think they are making sure to use fresh ingredients, but I do prefer straw mushrooms (I think they are usually canned) over the button mushrooms they used. Next time I am probably going to try out a veggie version (i love the soup with the cabbage, and broccoli). The owner did tell me they are trying to be authentic and so maybe button mushrooms and less veggies is more authentic?

We then got shrimp pad thai and chicken pad keo mao (drunken noodle) minus the red pepper. Both were tasty, the portions were probably a little less than other places in Reno (not sure if just lunch sized portion now that I think about it).

Like Ernie said, the pad thai noodles were a little soft, overdone, and its not the 'orange-y' sauce like other pad thai's, but there was still flavor there. The shrimp were also tasty in this dish. The drunken noodles was done exactly how I like them, lots of baby corns and the noodles covered in the sauce and of course spicy. 

My dad and I talked outside for a while and the husband did come out and talk with me about the food, and asked if I was happy (we were outside a while). I hope the living social deals bring in some business, and I do plan on coming back, it is just hard because I don't live in the area. I also asked about the cooking classes (they are a steal at $65), and on facebook it said they are looking to improve and give some focus to that side of the business. The owner did say that they use just a regular kitchen so no woks or anything like that (meaning what they teach us can actually be done at home), I wonder if that is why the pad thai noodles are that way? Regardless, they seem to pride themselves on authentic and quality food and service.

I did include pictures. Oh I did try a thai iced tea for the first time too, pretty tasty, reminded me of chai tea. 

I didn't get to see the bill closely, but it was $24 and some change after the living social deal (takes $20 off), I didn't think that was too bad for 2 for lunch (the total cost), with an appetizer and soup and a drink.
--------------------
Well, well.... Where do I start with this place? First time experience, went in with my partner.

Walking in at about 7:30 on a Friday night (st paddys day weekend even)  and the  place had about 4 customers. That should have been my first clue as to what our experience was going to be like.

We seated ourselves and the waitress, an older gal maybe mid to late 40's who had greasy stringy unwashed hair and rotting teeth came up and took our drink order. My girlfriend got a Dr. Pepper and I got a water. She brought out Coke instead of DP. No biggie. We let it go, assuming it was an honest mistake. After about 10 minutes she returns and we order a 12 piece "jumbo" wing basket ($11.99), a 6 piece($7.99), and a beer batter sampler($11.99). 20 minutes pass and finally here comes our appetizer. The waitress throws the basket of appetizers on the table  and says "here's your food." Very flat with a big attitude and walks off. The beer battered mushrooms were doughy and undercooked. We had a single half full ranch cup to share between us for the big platter and she avoided our table when she saw we needed more.
***let me note that this waitress is giving the customers at the 3 tables surrounding us WAY better customer service. Even brought their food out in a timely manner with no attitude whatsoever.
I decide to let the mushrooms slide for the moment. I used to work in a restaurant and I understand that mistakes happen, however this far into the experience I'm being mighty generous since it's a first time experience.
We finish our appetizer and we wait and wait and wait and finally she comes by and takes the platter returning 10 minutes later with our wings. She makes no inquiry about the broken open, clearly undercooked, mushrooms still sitting on the platter.
I got the 12 piece with a single half full ranch. Again. Food on the table, doesn't ask if we need anything else which is something she is doing for other customers. at this point we have been here for about 40 minutes.

I got half regular and half thai flavor. The wings were NOT jumbo. They were puny. The flavor was good for the thai, and the waitress even stopped by to check up on us, though I wouldn't consider walking by quickly and saying in your flat attitude tone "youguysdoingalright?okaycool." Really all that helpful since she came and went so fast it took me a second to understand her. I had to reiterate for my girlfriend.  When I started on the regular I bit into my drumstick and had to fish a feather out of my mouth. DISGUSTING. It was that point that the entire experience was completely and thoroughly unacceptable.  The wings were soggy because they batter them or something on top of all that.  At first I had no plans other than to pay for the meal and leave the waitress 2 pennies and be on my merry way. But when the waitress came and asked if we needed a box I said no with 6 wings still on my plate, OBVIOUS SOMETHING WAS WRONG, again. She was going to take my stuff and make no inquiry to right the situation. I asked for the manager. Took a minute but finally the manager came over (mind you it is still pretty dead, what are these people doing I wonder?) I explained the food issues but blew off bringing up our treatment by the waitress. Normally I give the benefit of the doubt on this one but it was blatantly obvious that we were being treated differently with a different attitude than other patrons because we are a same-sex couple. Like our table had a contagious disease that prevented us from getting food in a timely manner, and getting drink and condiment refills too, regardless of the *empty* cups on the edge of the table. It wasn't like we were off in the distance. She had to walk by our table every time to communicate with the surrounding tables.

Anyways. The manager experience wasn't the greatest, but I wasn't going to pay for that meal after the feather thing, and she comped everything. BUT only after slightly arguing with us about the undercooked mushrooms, which by the way come frozen which  makes the fact that they weren't cooked all the way acceptable I guess? Don't know. Don't care. I WILL NOT BE GOING BACK!!!

2 stars because they did comp the meal, the waitress got lucky. If I would have had to pay for anything she wouldn't have gotten a tip due to the attitude but we left her $4 anyway since we didn't have to pay for the meal.  THAT IS THE ONLY REASON.
1 star though for the overall experience. Same-sex couples, steer clear. You aren't welcome there and it's obvious.
--------------------
Unfortunately, I'm NOT happy after coming to this salon yet again. I got a message from the owner saying he'd like to have me come in to receive a FREE service because they previously ruined my hair. So, I thought since he's the owner my hair would turn out good but I was wrong. I'm really unhappy with this whole experience. I showed him multiple photos on google of what I wanted done to my hair which was a lot of blonde. I told him I do not want any ORANGE in my hair as I wanted a "white blonde". He said you won't have any orange in your hair. I have a message from him the OWNER saying I would receive a FREE service if I deleted my previous review. He should of NEVER offered a free service if it wasn't really free! So, I said how much because I thought I was getting my hair done for free. He said since your hair is long and thick you'll have to pay for the hair color and "medicine" but he won't charge me for his time. I said ok how much he said $80. He said it would cost me $180 if he didn't give me a discount which is very pricey. He put a lot of highlights on my hair and worked quickly as he seemed to want to rush on my hair which I do not like. My hair is important to me, I don't want my hair to fall out. He said this medicine he's gonna put on my hair is $50 for a treatment and that I needed it because of the blonde going on my hair which I know any coloring is damaging and blonde is very damaging but he said he charges everyone who gets hair color for this so called medicine which they mix into the color you dye your hair. You can purchase the entire set online (3 bottles) for $75 which is supposed to give you like 15 applications so he's definitely charging a lot of money! He only put No.1 on my hair and not No.2 or No.3. He also had a lady (the receptionist) wash out my hair? Ok, even though she was nice why would he have her do that when she said she knows nothing about hair because I asked if she's styling my hair and she said she doesn't do hair and I wouldn't want her to do my hair. As I was waiting there was a lady next to me, she got her hair cut and a perm. She was done but she wasn't happy, she told the lady she didn't like the hair cut and she had her style it more and trim off a little more but the lady still wasn't happy. The girl told the client when she washes her hair it will be better.. um how? I know she left very unhappy! Also the lady behind me was getting her hair cut and when he (the owner) was done cutting her hair she looked in the mirror and wanted it different and styled different so that made me have to wait longer but 2 clients were not happy and also myself. That's not a good look TJ nail and spa! I had a towel on my head and waited about 30 mins just to get my hair blow dried because he was cutting another clients hair. I seen orange roots, I was mad!!! He finally came over and I said I don't like the orange color on my roots, can you put a toner on my hair and he said it's not orange it's the lighting. The lighting?! It wasn't the lighting! He proceeds to blow dry hair and then starts straighten it without asking me if I wanted it straightened or curled, you are supposed to pick how you want your hair styled. At that point I knew my hair wasn't what I wanted and it wasn't gonna be fixed even if I wanted it too. I just sat there in the hair, mad and yet again very disappointed! I looked in the mirror and seen my hair damaged and brittle, orange and brassy and not even close to what I wanted. There goes my money down the drain, yet again. I will not be back to get my hair ruined and he made me delete my previous review which was also 0-1 stars before I left his salon but I had to write this one, this is real, this is honest, beware of getting your hair completely ruined and nothing close to what you want! Like I said I showed the OWNER multiple photos and I stated I did NOT want any orange on my hair but I did have orange on my hair, I didn't get what I wanted like he said, he said he doesn't mess up, he's been doing hair for years. As a salon owner I think he should take the time to really do what the client wants and achieve what the client wants done to their hair, if the workersowner would do that then there shouldn't be any bad reviews but there is so that shows you they do not care, not even the owner cares. They just want to rush and get done to get paid, they don't care if the customer is happy or not. There are more bad reviews from people going to this salon and having horrible experiences but he is bribing people to delete their bad reviews because he told me the bad reviews is hurting his business which is why people do reviews, to let people know this place is awesome or this place is horrible, beware, stay away. I do reviews to let people know the good, the bad and the ugly. I do reviews anywhere and I'm always 100% honest. So, if bad reviews hurt his business that is all on him and his employees not me or anyone else.
