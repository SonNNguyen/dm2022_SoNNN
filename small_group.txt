--------------------
SRS is truly an exceptional management company. They have been extremely accommodating with very specific requests that I have made. Recommend.
--------------------
First time at Wolfgang. Crowded, dirty floors, poor service, it has it all. Only redeeming factor was the excellent crisp Chardonnay.
--------------------
Awesome service and food.  Served with a dry ice fog thing that add a layer of coolness to the whole experience.
--------------------
Decent falafel wrap...but not exactly cheap. And the cave-like sitting area was cold and uninviting. There are better choices in Manayunk.
--------------------
I only go here when I need something that Trader Joes doesn't carry. They are overpriced, and understaffed. Not a fan.
--------------------
Holy bat crap, this place is amazing. Go to place in St. Pete, anything on the menu was good. Food coma!
--------------------
Best chicken you could ever hope for in bourbon st. The chicken is good. The sauce is good. Everything is goof

Service was crappy, and food was mediocre.  I wish I would have picked some other place for my last dinner in town.

Authentic flavor and ultra healthy
--------------------
Finally there is a place in Stl to eat sautéed seafood in  plastic bag! The sauce is a big plus. Good service.
--------------------
Great rolls and sake. We sat in the bamboo room, which definitely added to the experience, if you are able and agile.
--------------------
Sat down over a half hour, only miso and drinks served. Waiting for actual food ordered or someone to cook it ....waiting ...
--------------------
Zero stars for the Chicken Teriyaki Lunch Bento Box.  I have literally never seen a bento box come without rice before.  

Disappoint.
--------------------
We have great food every time we are here. Great milkshakes, ice cream, Chicago dogs, and cheese fries. Super affordable and delicious!
--------------------
If you're a Latino, you're best staying away from this place.
The lady that cut my hair was rude and very unprofessional.
--------------------
Definitely recommend for anyone looking for a delicious meal at a reasonable price. The shrimp and goat cheese crepes are a must have!

--------------------
Super cute place! Employees are very nice! Cookie dough is delicious! This is a must & we are glad we found it (lost while in town).
--------------------
Cheap food and large selection. Unfortunately, they forgot our order, we waited 15 minutes and they were not even sorry about it. Bad customer service.
--------------------
Good and fast service....meat is always very juice ....BBQ sauce is great...prices are reasonable...if you this truck around stop and try you won't be disappointed
--------------------
Excellent menu with locally sourced food that constantly changes. A delight for your taste buds. Reservations can be hard to get, so plan in advance.
--------------------
Great job first day open packed but well organized me and my family will be back multiple times a week. Thanks for coming to reno.
--------------------
Super tasty and enormous portions. Some unique flavors too. Not much else to say but an amazing ice cream store that others should try to emulate.
--------------------
Not the best prepared sushi inthe city by a longshot, but for quick (and I mean quick), cheap sushi with a long menu, Mixx is great.
--------------------
Great place for a drink, nice friendly staff.  Didn't eat there though and would be hesitant to as it doesn't look to be the cleanest place.
--------------------
I love these guys. Tony is one of big help. Had flat tire and he got it fixed less that what his estimation expectation. 

Thank you!
--------------------
Very cute place and good food. Pear cider beer was really good the service was really good and great ambiance and the price was very reasonable

Great service, food was ok..  Wish the soups were served warmer, and my steak was cooked well done, when requested medium. 

However the service was excellent.
--------------------
Great spot for pho! Broth is very good. I ordered No. 51 (small) and it was filling. Would definitely come back again when I'm in Philly.
--------------------
If you like onion rings order them here. Some of the best I have ever have. I also had a Reuben which was very good also.
--------------------
I got the hot shave and it did not disappoint. They do 6 towels and a facial massage with oils in between. Great shave, great environment.
--------------------
Delicious crab cocktail and my husband loved his steamers. 

Only down fall is it is really humid in the restaurant itself. A fan would be nice.
--------------------
Excellent customer service. I wish I could rent from there more often! Had such a great experience verses other car rental services. 

Rent if you can!
--------------------
food is ok, felt rushed, too many tables and not enough space.  its very crowded and frequently had other servers and customers bumping into our chairs.
--------------------
crappy restarurant with awful service and rude waiter. if you are looking for a GOOD BYO italian restaurant, go to La Baia on 17th and Lombard!
--------------------
Great tour! Very informative  (our tour guide Raymond was awesome!) and the food stops along the way were very delicious. Definitely worth the time and money.
--------------------
Amazingly amazing wings and homemade bleu cheese. Had the ribeye: tender, perfectly prepared, delicious. Nice selection of craft beers. Would DEFINITELY recommend checking out this hidden gem.
--------------------
Eat here at least 2 times a week. Servers are always friendly and the food is amazing. I never leave disappointed & always leave with a full stomach
--------------------
Love in n out. There's just a mood for in n out that you have to fulfill sometimes.

What can I say. 4 patties animal style bruh
--------------------
The service here has gone down. We used to go here a lot but now we go to another one. The service was slow and forgotten about.
--------------------
I love going in there just to look around. The prices are a bit high, but the store is like a Disneyland for adults. I LOVE IT!
--------------------
We really liked this place. Everything we had was delicious. Portions were big. Chicken parm was so yummy. Can't wait to go back and try more stuff !
--------------------
My hairdresser was very thorough in getting details of what I wanted. Then she checked frequently during the haircut to make sure I liked it.  I did!
--------------------
This place was absolutely awesome. 75 cent oysters. After 2 dozen I moved to the excellent cheesy grits. Great place to eat. Even better during happy hour.
--------------------
Pleasantly surprised to find Taiwanese restaurant in Reno. Convenient to all of the hotels.  Solid boba tea and authentic Taiwanese food if you know what to order
--------------------
awesome place.  good food. nice people.  rotating specials.  all home made.  what else do you want?  Chicken salad is a great pickup to make sandwiches at home.
--------------------
I ordered the Pulled Pork Nachos.  They were delicious!  Instead of tortilla chips they are served with potato chips...perfect to share with a Beer or Bloody Mary
--------------------
The Tater-Tots were good but not anything I haven't  had before. Burger was satisfactory.  Quick stop for lunch.  Staff was helpful with providing directions to local attractions.
--------------------
I can say this is the best burger of my life!

You sit outside and Goleta holester Ave is nothing special.   But the burger is the best
--------------------
Hands down the best spaghetti & meatballs I've ever had. The atmosphere here is so nice and cozy. It has just won out as my favorite Italian restaurant.
--------------------
This place is awesome. A real throwback. Music is great, 4 stars (not 5) as they don't really offer seating beyond the first 15 ppl in line.
--------------------
Rons still a regular stop for me.  Usually some good craft beers  (excellent this week) and tasty food  (if you know what to stick with on menu).
--------------------
Food is excellent!
People are welcoming, choices are long list. Sandwiches have great meat in them. Hand made toasted ravioli is some of the best in town.
--------------------
Great staff always helps and always nice. Always clean and huge store size. Stays stocked with everything you need. The staff always helps make my custom breakfast bagel
--------------------
Awesome little shop.  The owner really knows his stuff and you can tell he loves his work.  They have tires and other parts you won't find anywhere else.
--------------------
Enjoyed my fish out at a sidewalk table.  A bit pricey but food was good.  Go to Side street in French quarter if u want quieter dining outside.
--------------------
Prompt and professional. On a Saturday.
Simple mirror fix, but they made it easy for me. I have used them in Charlotte and they were great then, too.
--------------------
Always fun to go to their shows.  Entertaining and relaxed atmosphere. For a good time and good food at a fair price this is the place to go.
--------------------
1st time eating here. Very clean, nice folks and very good sushi.  Would and will go back. Service was spot on, sushi was very fresh and reasonably priced .
--------------------
Fantastic sliders!! Perfect size that you can try more than one!  Fried chicken slider, BLT slider, monte cristo and Cuban were all fantastic!  Now for Donuts to go!!
--------------------
I went there for drinks and found the environment really nice with the brewery right there. The beer was good and the waiter was very knowledgable and kind
--------------------
The food here is so great and fresh. I don't shy away from my kids favorite Wonton Soup because i know they take the time to cook it.
--------------------
This place is super cute! I love how sustainable they are. Definitely recommend. The people are awesome and pretty! Not to mention the food and coffee are extraordinary!
--------------------
Awesome food! It was so fresh and delicious. The papaya salad was delicious! Try the curry..simply spicy and beautiful. The service was great too! They have take out!!!
--------------------
Delicious! Best place around for ice cream . Everything is made fresh from cows without hormones and antibiotics . It's cash only, but it's worth the trip to the ATM.
--------------------
I've been a few times and I haven't been disappointed yet. Its for meat eaters, vegetarians, and vegans. It's nice to have a healthy place to go to.
--------------------
The food is delicious but the service has always been pretty slow if not bad which would be understandable if it was busy it's just usually it's not .
--------------------
There  aren't  enough  stars  to  review  The  Pearl ! Food , service  and  ambiance . I  enjoy  every  minute  of  every  visit ! Not  just  dinner , a genuine  dining  experience  ! Pamper  yourself !
--------------------
This place had fantastic donuts! They were very well priced and so soft. We tried the blueberry cake donut and apple fritter. We will definitely be going back.
--------------------
All you can drink brunch? Yes please!

Sat and Sun they got brunch item and unlimited bloody marys or mimosas for $20. Perfect for some Sunday Funday. Enjoy!
--------------------
I was very impressed! I had a plain glazed and a glazed with a lemon filling. I would go back again if I ever find myself in Indy.
--------------------
Great rich food,  but a lil bit pricey.  Everything tastes wonderful but nothing stays the same the menu is always changing.  The most unique donuts you will find.
--------------------
Great place for breakfast! I had the waffle, which was fluffy and perfect, and home fries which were nice and smashed and crunchy. Friendly waitstaff. Will definitely be back!
--------------------
Nice relaxing place to get a massage! Same day appointments are easy to come by! I have never been disappointed with any therapist I have had at the Center!
--------------------
This is one of the best hotels I have ever stayed at.  Clean, polite staff, nice pool and grand entrance.   I can't wait until next year to come back.
--------------------
Best shrimp and grits in NOLA! Delicious fresh juices too. This is my fiance's second time here in two years and he still thinks it's the best he's tried.
--------------------
Perfect place for a date night. The sweet potato nachos and the "breakfast" we're to die for! Really everything we tried was delicious...I can't wait to go back again.
--------------------
This place is so lovely! I went for a sweet and was amazed at the variety. The gooey butter cookies were awesome and the German chocolate cupcake simply amazing!
--------------------
Great spot I've been coming here for years. Top 3 steaks in the city! Nothing has changed even after the name change. Try a chicken cheesesteak for something different
--------------------
Obviously they are doing something right since they have been around since 1958. Great soft serve and scooped ice cream cones, boats, floats and sundaes.
Prices great too.  Enjoy!
--------------------
Had breakfast with the family after a quick stopover. Great food and service (thanks Jonathan!), definaelty a good find that was busy but had no wait on a Saturday.
--------------------
Great happy hour.  And brunch.  Only had dinner there once and it was only OK- probably because I ordered something I don't typically eat.  It'll definitely try it again.
--------------------
the foods great, but no buflight on tap.i love the servers there , especially Jamie White, whose the best server. But again. Lack of Bud light is a big negative
--------------------
I'm not really into the fast food scene BUT Chick fil A is a step above. Great quality food! I don't feel like I'm eating a ton of fillers!
--------------------
Excellent service! Great diner food and breakfast is served all day. Came here for lunch- they were busy but very friendly and hospitable. Easy to get to off the 295.
--------------------
The ramen is okay, nothing spectacular. Service is okay. Good place for a quick stop but wouldn't go if there were other choices. Been here twice, will continue to go.
--------------------
Had the brisket sandwich with two sides and a drink for 9.99 - Great barbecue at an affordable price. Wonderful side such as potato casserole cream spinach baked beans green beans
--------------------
Great food. Terrible customer service. I've been three times and I've had two different older waitresses. Not pleasant to deal with whatsoever. The owner on the other hand is lovely.
--------------------
Great bar Happy Hour 4-7 every day. Wine & Drafts $3, $5 pizza, $4.50 apps. To-go Dinners and lunches are very reasonable and fast. Staff are as friendly as it gets.
--------------------
The Shop is an amazing space! Their attention to detail and services are unbelievable. Plenty of places to have private meetings as well as post up and get work done.
--------------------
Best Pizza period. Love the staff and the beer is always cold and the taps are always maintained. If you want fresh beer and a slice it's only 5 bucks.
--------------------
Good price, great location and good accommodations with decently sized rooms. The bed is pretty firm though and the sheets are super rough but overall, I would stay here again!
--------------------
Cute place, nice servers and good food but dish sizes are waaaaay too small. I left unsatisfied. I don't like it when restaurants are cheap with portions, especially neighborly ones!
--------------------
Good food--loved the gnocchi with marinara
the baked eggplant appetizer was very good too

The service was very slow, but despite this, I'd go back, the food is just that good
--------------------
My husband and I come here often. We love the food here, it's always fresh and the service is great. We highly recommend this place to anyone who loves sushi & hibachi.
--------------------
Excellent food. We tried three appetizers and five entries and all of them were a hit. This prices are reasonable and the service is good. I'd go back again and again.
--------------------
Blew $80 on food for the family was worth it food was hot and orange chicken best I've tasted in a awhile..now it will be the place we get Asian food!!
--------------------
Best Indian I have ever had! The food was fresh and delicious. Staff are very friendly and attentive and restaurant is clean and welcoming. The paleek paneer and briyani were amazing!
--------------------
Ordered a Passion Passport, I love the name! It contains Passion Fruit Juice Blend, Bananas, Pineapple Mango Juice Blend, Papaya Juice Blend, and Raw Cane Sugar. It was delicious and refreshing!
--------------------
Very friendly staff and nice environment although the crowd was light surprisingly the both times I went there. Get yourself a $3.50 margarita after 4 on Tuesdays, they are pretty good.
--------------------
Nothing extraordinary, but if you want some simple Chinese takeout, this is the best place around. The food seems less greasy than you sometimes find and the people are super nice.
--------------------
Waited 27 minutes for three teas (no one else was in the store when we came in and ordered). NO tea is worth that long of a wait, especially in Chinatown.
--------------------
Great customer service! Love my new car! Highly recommend to anyone who's trying to buy a new used car in good shape! Talk to Andy if you want some good help!
--------------------
Good drinks and food. Had the pulled pork and fried chicken po boy. Mac and cheese was amazing. Very reasonable for the price. Great draft list as well. Serves food till1am.
--------------------
Great store if you like 50's-Midcentury modern! The prices are a little high compared to my favorite stores in STL, but this store is one of a kind thats for sure!
--------------------
Great family restaurant feel. Po boys had the perfect bread. We had 3 different kinds and all were tasty. Mac 'n Cheese was good and a little spicy. Really fabulous service.
--------------------
Great birthday cakes...I mean it.
  BUT: The cupcakes and cookies out front tend to be stale at times...although when I have complained they made good on everything. 
  I will go back!
--------------------
Found Player's while driving by. Everyone is very friendly. The service is great. Atmosphere is very relaxed. Great experience overall. Oh and a great shave and cut for a great price!
--------------------
If I could give this place 6 stars I would. Don't let the looks deceive you, great diner food. Biscuits and gravy were incredible. Portions were more than I could eat.
--------------------
This is not Middle Eastern food. Side dishes were awfully tasting, including a warmed up rice, which I am sure came from a frozen bag few minutes before it was served.
--------------------
This place is terrible. Terrible service, terrible food, and the place is dirty beyond reason.  Really hope I don't have food poisoning after eating here, but I wouldn't bet on it.
--------------------
After 3 weeks of working in the area I finally found a place off of Magazine that is not overrated. Friendly staff! Y'all know I love Phò so it's pretty damn good!
--------------------
Steve & his partner are the best! Love that he'll do a bunch of demo racquets! Great prices with lots to choose from. If you're a player this is the place to go!
--------------------
Exactly as bougie and casual at the same time as you need it to be. Come with your Gucci bag or in your yoga pants and slam a delicious cocktail or three.
--------------------
Very good breakfast. Within walking distance of our hotel. Had the crepes with fruit. Would get again for sure. Not sure about the tea. Had a hint of fennel seed to it.
--------------------
not impressed!..... the service was great but the pizza i ordered was not good. i love Stella and Trenos pizza so i wast expecting the same type. no desire to return again
--------------------
Great bar and atmosphere. Bartenders are very friendly as well as the owner. Mixed crowd and staff makes everyone feel welcomed and right at home! The  BBQ truck parked outside is excellent!!
--------------------
Ive eaten there twice and both times it was terrible. Steak was salty, fish dry, my salad was frozen , service awful. . Im really not sure how this place gets any good reviews.
--------------------
I love this gas station. I work at a hotel on the beach and send guests here just about every day. Also it's the only one on Clearwater Beach that's open 27/7
--------------------
I had the carrot cake.... Very disappointed tasted like licorice and baking soda cooking powder. It's too bad because everything looks so delicious :( also didn't like the chocolate chips in it either.
--------------------
Really nice place to get a pedicure! People are very friendly and it is a relaxing environment. Definitely recommend if you are looking for a clean place to get your toes done!
--------------------
Loved this place, especially the Salmon. Only eaten here at Lunch and not a problem. Going to add this one to my Lunch rotation.
Spotless restrooms and the service is top notch.
--------------------
Tried this place the other day the pizza was not very good at all the place before this one was so much better all home made food with it would've stuck around
--------------------
They call a chicken salad sandwich two cubes of chicken with mayo in it and a salad with a salad that is a bowl Of lettuce a salad? Hmm left here hungry....
--------------------
Wow! I never thought my sons phone could be repaired after he dropped it but it is and it took less than a half an hour! Very professional and excellent service! I'm thrilled!
--------------------
Was in town for a week and came by this little hole in the wall.  The pa nang chicken was excellent.  I ordered one star spicy and it came quick.  Will definitely return.
--------------------
This is my favorite restaurant!  I always order their ceviche, which is delicious.  The atmosphere is fun, and the service is great.  Alex was our server, and he was friendly, attentive and thoughtful.
--------------------
It's no different than any other Chinese place. Same menu, etc. this place does have some good lunch specials though, and the food is always ready when I go to pick it up.
--------------------
My first time here! Grace did my hair....and it's FABULOUS! (And my hair is very difficult---super long and super thick). Great atmosphere, too--modern and clean, and no snobbiness.  Totally reasonable pricing! Highly recommend!
--------------------
This is the best location EVER. The donuts are made to order I believe after 5pm. They are always super hot you can barely eat them . Even the next day they are delicious.
--------------------
My wife and I loved everything about this diner. The decor is lovely & the food was great. I had the cheese steak and it was much better than Geno's.  Our server was awesome
--------------------
Came to see my son's band Last Frontier. The staff and food here is top notch!   Had the porkbelly and fish nachos.  Awesome.  Great selection of whisky. Great sound system for the band.
--------------------
Great hangout for wine, cheese, and some music outside.  Tried some of the food - bacon-wrapped dates & brussel sprouts - all unmemorable.  Also tried the sardines which smelled and tasted past their prime - sent back.
--------------------
My husband and I held our wedding reception at Hendel's Cafe and it was gorgeous, just a beautiful night and a perfect place in which to spend with our closest friends and family!
--------------------
Food is on point.  I am deducting 1 star for the condition of the bathrooms on the Friday night I went.. Toilet didn't flush, no toilet paper or paper towels and overall gross.
--------------------
Cute Japanese restaurant in Old City. Fresh sushi and amazing ramen. Wonderful customer service! This is my new favorite go to for sushi and ramen. There is a great selection on the menu.
--------------------
This is a nice Indian buffet with a pretty wide selection.  There is nothing that will make you say "wow", but many good Indian dishes for a very reasonable price.  Would return again.
--------------------
There's been three times that I've ordered a green tea lemonade and got a peach tea lemonade and had to turn all the way back and go inside and have theme remake it.
--------------------
Salad was good.  Pizza is not good!  Boring, tasteless and just unsatisfying.  Very disappointed.  Also on a chilly night it is a cold interior.  This was my third try there.  Won't go back
--------------------
Creative food and good. We get coffee or tea while we wait to be seated and even that is a cut above.  We love their Bloody Marys too.  Always interesting and an adventure.
--------------------
Love, Love, LOVE this store!!!  I admit, I'm an addict. But where else can you get a Bebe top, a Banana Republic skirt and a BCBG skirt for $4.13?????  The savings are ridiculous!
--------------------
OMG! Breakfast pizza and bottomless mimosas and bloody marys. Is there anything better in this world? Even got a handshake on the way out the door. Service like that seems scarce these days
--------------------
We get high on the beauty of this amazing high desert oasis! Nature's drama in the Catalina Mountains. We come here to run or hike. We're #MCLifeTucson - we love it in the canyon!
--------------------
Haven't eaten at Wendy's in a long time but these have really changed for the better. Fries with sea salt!  Really good quality for fast food. Normally I don't even rate fast food!!!
--------------------
My brother and I ate here to celebrate my college graduation and I must say I was very satisfied. Great vibes in the restaurant, our waiter was outstanding, and the food was delish.
--------------------
Great food and excellent service. Only knock I would give them was they brought out our entrees about 10 minutes after our apps came so we were still eating that, otherwise great experience
--------------------
Farmhouse, rustic, chic.Helpful staff with great ideas to decorate your home. Prices reasonable. Store has items from Joanna Gaines ( Fixer Upper) and much more. Finally a good home store in SB with reasonable prices.
--------------------
Westfall replaced our roof in April. We could not be more pleased with the entire process. Quality roof, excellent communication and excellent follow up. Very happy we chose this company to replace our roof.
--------------------
Took a while to get actual service but once we did I was happy. The gumbo was awesome and loved the chicken & waffles. Friendly staff and right on Bourbon St for good people watching!
--------------------
We sat at a pretty hectic lunch at Johnny rockets in the casino. Our server was Lyndel! She was awesome! Helped us at every needy request lol... Good was good, too! I'm too full
--------------------
This place is fantastic. The food is exceptional and the service couldn't be better. Very nice and generous people with a cool atmosphere. I eat here almost every weekend. Can't beat the Cuban espresso!
--------------------
Good, but expensive. 

We both had steak, and it was pretty darn good. 

The guacamole is nothing special. Yes, it gets made in front of you, but it gets made wrong in my opinion.
--------------------
Great classic Greek diner. The Greek omelette with feta, gyro meat, tomato and spinach was super. Classic griddle home fries and outstanding service. We will seek it out when we return to the area.
--------------------
We stopped by a couple of weeks ago for Sunday brunch.  The food was very good and filling.  Nice drinks, and we had a very pleasant server.  Cool cafe space.  Overall a good recommend.
--------------------
Soooooo good! Tuesday is the night to go! Selection of 1/2 price tapas and Sangria/margaritas are $5.00. 
We loved the Fried Manchego, Hot Cauiliflower, and Camarones! 
This was over the top unique and tasty!!
--------------------
Great burgers,fries and salad!  Burgers have a hint of salt and pepper flavor.

This location is very quaint. They only have outdoor seating

Friendly staff.

Street parking as well as parking lot in the back.
--------------------
They have the WORST service advisors! Used to be good before Kelly and her team left. Unfortunately, it's convenient to work if I need oil change before I can make it to another Honda dealer.
--------------------
Thoroughly enjoyed our private tour today with Carrie (it was very rainy so not too many visitors).  Her knowledge and passion about the Civil War was captivating. The Battle of Franklin deserves such a memorial.
--------------------
Came here on a Monday at lunch time. I sat at the bar and received fast service. Ordered their carne asada taco lunch special which were better than average. More than pleased with this place
--------------------
Quaint place with great ambience, food and service. I had the Shrimp Po Boy. It was delicious. The fries and cole slaw were perfect side dishes. This was my first visit. Definitely not my last.
--------------------
I highly recommend this place! This was our first "Chef Tasting"! It was exquisite!! We had 9 courses and all were truly delicious. Wine was amazing. If you are in Philly, I highly recommend Vetri.
--------------------
If you want The Best burger in Philly, this is the right place to come. The bread was fresh, meat was nothing but juicy, service was a amiable, price was descent and affordable to everybody!
--------------------
We have used Reno Vulcanizing for several years now and will not take a vehicles to anyone else. Ken, Bruce and all the other staff I have dealt with are always honest, courteous and helpful.
--------------------
I've only eaten at Cosi when I travel. I've eaten at this location a few times. I like their flatbreads and salads. 
There bbq chicken Flatbread is good. It's a pretty good portion size too.
--------------------
I went here to get my wisdom teeth out and they did a great job. The only complaint I have is that I never see the same dentist. I've been going here for 5 years.
--------------------
simply the best! everything from here is good! I come from a very Italian family and whenever there is a family event, there is always Termini brothers dessert trays! Their cannolis are amazing! Highly recommend.
--------------------
The pasta was cooked perfectly, chicken parm was delicious and pizza was good. What amazes me most is in a packed place this one cashier/waitress was able to do it all seamless and well. Impressed
--------------------
Great food... Love the Fish tacos & Nachos are great  it's really a nice atmosphere for family settings and night or dates too.. Music beach bar, home made ice cream  & a little play ground - it's great
--------------------
I went here based on the Yelp reviews and found everything to be true. The staff is extremely helpful and willing to answer all questions. I will continue to bring my bike repair/maintenance needs here.
--------------------
Pretty average take-out chinese. Not bad, not the best, but id definitely eat there again. ***update--- just ate there again and they got our complex delivery perfect and the food was excellent! 5 stars now!!
--------------------
I was a little worried about seeing the reviews but everything. Was great! Not long wait time. Staff was nice from walking in the lobby and asking which way to the office, to the office staff.
--------------------
Hipsters unite!  I've never had a good time at The Taint, despite several people's attempts top tell me otherwise.  I'm not impressed by the apathy here, or the dirty-headed Garden District crapfest of regular clientele.  Boo.
--------------------
Lots of improvements to this place. Much more comfortable environment now.  The chairs could be a bit more comfortable as it'd be nice to sit through an entire football game. Otherwise, this place has really improved.
--------------------
I went here when if first opened, and have never desired to go back again, I was so very disappointed at the quality and the taste of the food. I would absolutely not recommend dining here.
--------------------
My partner and I split the vegetarian platter and left stuffed! Delicious food, very kind and attentive staff.  Will help you make decisions on ordering and certainly won't take advantage of you. Will definitely be back.
--------------------
This is the best Italian food I've ever had. Very small elegant restaurant, entrees were really good and very tasty cheesecake. To top it off, the entire staff was super friendly. Highly recommended for date night.
--------------------
This place is a lot of fun. I like that there is a outdoor patio with hip hop music and indoor dance area with salsa . If you need a change in tunes or scenery , just move !
--------------------
Listen up, people!  Fall off the bone mushy ribs are not what you get at a proper barbeque joint!  If you want that stuff, then go elsewhere.  Smoked ribs are meant to be a little tough.
--------------------
This is my favorite place to enjoy gelato in St. Louis. 

Consider the... 

Coffee house-like atmosphere. 
Large outdoor patio with a fountain and surrounding foliage. 
Delicious gelato and baked goods. 

Yes, everything at Gelateria is pleasing.
--------------------
Wells Fargo is a great atmosphere for all ages. Flyers host a great game every time I got no matter where you sit. I would recommend everyone to a game even if you don't like hockey!!
--------------------
Love this place! Almost all of their menu items can be made vegan. They are super knowledgeable. The Pad Thai with tofu, veggies, and cashews is perfection. The avocado egg rolls are amazing too! A favorite.
--------------------
I eat here at least once a month, and more often when possible.  The brisket tacos and brisket quesadillas are fantastic.  Happy hour starts at 3 if you're interested in a late lunch for 2-for-1 drinks.
--------------------
Nothing more to say than this is the BEST donut place ever. I literally wished they shipped their products. When I moved to Florida, I missed it so much. It's only in New Orleans... sad face!
--------------------
Food was good- atmosphere/decor is like a fishing lodge- menu is someplace between outback & bonefish. Went on a Groupon & all 3 of our meals & calamari appetizer that we ordered were cooked perfectly- we will def be back.
--------------------
Love it here! Their sips mocha is my go-to. Staff has always been so nice! Absolutely love that they have a drive thru too, helps not to unload my kiddos. Oh and their cakes are amazing too!
--------------------
I can walk here and won't go back even if they were the only place open at 2am.  I got the basic general tso's and it didn't come close to passing the test.  Go to East Cuisine.
--------------------
Pancake Pantry is an institution in Nashville. A place to see country stars and have a great breakfast. Pancakes are good. It's a thing to do in Nashville. Plan to stand in line and enjoy the conversation.
--------------------
Tasty brunch, extremely friendly staff, great cocktails, and cute and comfy design. I love having a lesbian bar in the neighborhood. I will be returning with my mom for Mothers' Day. I'm so happy this place exists.
--------------------
Overrated. This place is ok, often the crust is burned...maybe our pallets aren't sophisticated enough to appreciate that taste but it's not our thing. We enjoyed the cauliflower salad and the fried dough ball dessert is delish
--------------------
This was such a nice change from the other restaurants. Simple fresh organic food.  Full coffee, latte, etc options. Sasquatch brew is delicious. Also, very nice ambiance. Casual, relaxed, and comfortable. The owners are amazing and friendly.
--------------------
This is everything I want in take out food - fresh, yummy, and relatively healthy. I also love that there is a good to go place in Northern Liberties that is convenient - there is not enough of that!
--------------------
I Recently vacationed in St. Petersburg with my family. Dooners was definitely my favorite meal of the trip. Great food and incredibly helpful and friendly staff. Would definitely recommend to anyone, and wouldn't hesitate to go again.
--------------------
Please note: the coffee is excellent! However, you have to ask for cream and sugar. I find this pretentious and intimidating. It's coffee. I want it how I want it. It shouldn't be such a big deal.
--------------------
Just got a pedi so I can't speak to the massage but my pedi was amazing. Place is clean and very nice, I did not have to wait at all and most importantly they know their stuff.
--------------------
We have had a blast to each event we've been to.  We've been to concerts and basketball games and other were a lot of fun.  The food is really good, also.  A lot of local favorites are offered.
--------------------
I was here a few times before and didn't review. I come here for the food, NOT the service. The establishment is lacking in its service. Their food is always great though! Very delicious for a dive bar.
--------------------
This is my favorite nail shop in the city I've been going here for years....I enjoy the quiet serene atmosphere...the staff is very friendly and efficient....the price of $25.00 for a pedicure in the South....you can't beat it!
--------------------
I love this restaurant. The owners are the nicest family. The food is delicious!!. My favorite is bacon pizza. I love that there is a play room for my kids to play while we wait for our food.
--------------------
Rude and unprofessional staff. I called today to find out if they had availability over the Thanksgiving holiday and the staff was short and basically said no then hung up the phone. I will take my business elsewhere.
--------------------
Service was good. Mesquite wings are very good  best to share or save some don't be greedy like me and try.and go back to work. Only downside was the weak lemonade. It was the weakest I ever had.
--------------------
It may be a bit pricey, but it's good food in the cafe and a good selection in the grocery. I love their vegan sandwich and tofu melt and they always have a great selection of vegan sweets.
--------------------
My favorite place to eat sushi and the nicest people I know that work there! It'll always be my first choice and they have a great menu! It's always more than just good when you eat from there!
--------------------
these people are great.
through the years we've experienced everything and seen probably every doctor. these are true animal people, through and through, and you can always count on them for the best. not much else to say!
--------------------
Great talent but that is not important when time
Is more valuable. Sitting here on 3/23/18 at 11:28am. Supposedly opened at 11am. There are 5 of us waiting but no employee to provide service. Tsk, tsk Perfect Arch!
--------------------
Dinner for 9 was just fantastic. We celebrated a 70th birthday and received first class treatment all the way.  Sure it was very expensive but our steaks and entrees were outstanding. Great service, great food and great ambiance.
--------------------
After our recent trip to New Orleans, I came back to Reno appreciating this place even more than before! 
The shrimp po boy is my favorite thing on the menu! And their corn bread is amazing as well!
--------------------
Two very good experiences.  Excellent burger and very good pulled pork.  Wife loved her egg white and goat cheese omlette.  Solid beer list and a good spicy bloody Mary.  Also had great service and an ecclectic play list.
--------------------
I've dined here several times but the last two occasions we received poor service and the food was underwhelming. Very disappointing as we used to love to eat lunch here. Probably won't be back.  Not worth the money.
--------------------
First time there and it was excellent!!! It feels like your are entering someone's home. The waiters there funny and nice. The food come out very quickly and it is phenomenal!!! Definitely will be going back to this place.
--------------------
Federal Doughnuts is a new concession at the ballpark -- who doesn't love some doughnuts and fried chicken?  

Also, there is now a concession stand near 136 that is gluten-free dedicated.  They offer pizza, cheesesteaks and even brownies and cookies.
--------------------
A++ for ambience. Very cozy English pub feel. Great drinks too - the bartenders here know how to mix 'em. That being said, the prices are steep (I paid $7 for a standard mixed drink) and the seating is limited.
--------------------
My husband took me here for our Anniversary and it was such a delight! Hats off to the chef for the amazing dinner that melted in my mouth. And the customer service was top notch. Definitely will be back!
--------------------
Food is terrible and too expensive for how bad it is. Took over 2 hours for delivery. Rude on the phone when we called to see about our order status. Terrible decision to order from this place, never again.
--------------------
Mediocre food. very slow service , our food came one by one Within 10 to 15 minutes of each other. Rude servers and took us a long time to get our bills with lots of mistakes. Overall very bad experience
--------------------
I had the classic burger and fries. Overall pleased with my experience. The burger was well seasoned and the fries were pretty tasty. The service was on point. Also had to have a spiked milkshake....my choice the Bananas Foster.
--------------------
Worst roast pork sandwich I've ever had. The broccoli rabe was lifeless and freezing. It was so cold my cheese didn't melt. The bread was soggy and wet. Horrible. If I wasn't in an airport, I'd bring this back.
--------------------
You can't beat the prices for the unlimited food, but I've had better. The sushi is delicious, the salad was subpar and the crab Rangoon was probably the worst I've had. I've been twice and would definitely go again.
--------------------
I always am in favor of local businesses.  They have a big selection here and you get free popcorn.  Why go to the big boys and have to pay for popcorn when you can get it here for free?
--------------------
Expensive but great service & food. The ribeye melted in my mouth. The burger was huge & delicious w/ every bite. The bread pudding is everything it's hyped up to be. Definitely go at least once & share some meals w/ friends.
--------------------
Terrible service from the bar tender. Unless you are a regular she did not serve us. I was standing at the bar with money in my hand and she just kept going to the same old people. Very irritating!
--------------------
got my haircut here for the first time Jessie Becker took the damaged ends off. She's so sweet and does only what you ask of her. She's also great with kids. come see this place and come see her.
--------------------
Wow!  Yummy, different,  delicious.   Our favorite is the lamb curry and korma.  With 10 different kinds of naan!!!  Don't let the outside deter you (because we almost changed our minds)...go in and try something new!   You'll be glad you did!
--------------------
What a great addition to the Funk Zone!  Grab a bite, grab some tastings, life is good. Right next door to the Santa Barbara Wine Collective, in fact it actually shares the same tables.  We had a fabulous savory croissant.
--------------------
We have been here twice for brunch and have enjoyed it immensely. Everything we have tried has been delicious, particularly the grits with scallions and sour cream. But the room is always freezing so be sure to bring a sweater!
--------------------
Three stars not because of food, the food is good but, the service is slow. I think they need 1 or 2 more people up front when placing an order if your waiting and not using the kiosk to order.
--------------------
Becca is an awesome bartender. They have awesome happy hour specials including land shark. The food menu is somewhat limited but the service at the bar is great. We hope they can keep up the business and attract more locals.
--------------------
One of the few diners in North Wilmington, and the only one that probably isn't really bad. I've had totally ordinary diner fare here, and used to come by after swim meets. Nothing particularly good or bad about this place.
--------------------
Sweet and sour chicken and chicken chow mein were both excellent. I like the chicken cuts in the chow mein. Have also tried the sushi a few times and enjoyed it. A little pricey, but at least it's great food.
--------------------
The Lemon Cake is as good as it is heavy.    It was my second visit to Cake Life and I only chose not to get cupcakes because it would have been pure gluttony.   They ROCK!   Many more visits to come.
--------------------
The Smoked Salmon Frittata came with the smoked salmon, egg, potato, red bell peppers, goat cheese, horseradish -dil crema & fresh fruit. And it was as good as it sounded 

A very good mod dat brunch, dinner, and private dining spot.
--------------------
the best frozen yogurt i have found in the central bucks area (at the time of the initial review).  everyone is super friendly and the flavors are good.  but i have since found another location that is a rival.  :-0
--------------------
Hated this place I went in to try an egg roll and get a sushi roll and both were bad the egg was horrible and the sushi was chewy so I wasnt surprised that I was the only one there
--------------------
You need a Cinnamon Roll from the bake house.  You probably need two; life would have just a little less happiness and light without their Cinnamon Rolls.
The coffee and salads are also excellent, a lovely Saturday morning breakfast treat.
--------------------
Great staff.  Nothing is ever disappointing - chili cheese etoufee is the BOMB.  It's a 4 instead of 5 stars because it's CASH ONLY.  But I love that you can also sit outside on nice evening.  

Don't forget the garlic sauce!
--------------------
The Food here is bomb.com on Wednesday they have 1.00 jumbo wings and they are really good and seasoned just right. The drink i fell in love with is the Dirty Lemonade, If you're in Indianapolis come visit this place.
--------------------
Store is severely understaffed
Waiting in line to check out can take up to 25 minutes

Avoid this store if possible

The workers are nice, but they know they are understaffed to make the profits look better as a strategy
--------------------
Comfortable bed, good breakfast, fast internet, great location, and low price. Overall I was really impressed with this place. However, if you stay on the top floors you may be waiting up to 15 minutes for an elevator in the morning.
--------------------
This was such a unique spot, from the graffiti style art on the walls to the delicious food options and special hummus flavors. Good prices, great portion size. I had the greek steak pita with guac hummus. Will definitely be back!
--------------------
Hands down best fall off the bone BBQ I've ever had.Excellent pulled pork everything had that great smoky flavor.Very creamy mac and cheese.Service was fast and friendly. Dessert was equally as good walnut brownie and ice cream delight.Such a great find.
--------------------
Overpriced mediocrity.  Please don't waste your money here.  My family has eaten here twice and both times "corporate" has refunded the price of our meals because it has been so appalling.

This corporation/restaurant has no clue.  Please don't be ripped off.
--------------------
Their sushi is pretty good. Mesa rolls are my fav here. They would be 4stars if they gave better estimations for pick ups. It is typical that they lag a lot and they seem to make it after you show up.
--------------------
Staff member wouldn't let us use guest pass on our first time there. He said our only option was to buy at least a one day pass for $15/person. LOL. Went to Retro fitness for free trial; better equipment and environment:)
--------------------
Stopped for a very healthy burger while visiting Philly after performing a nearby Prince tribute show; discovered one of the greatest burger places on planet earth! Thank you Alya & company at Bareburger!!

This hotel has wonderful views of the airport, and it has the only revolving rooftop restaurant.  It's connected to the airport that has several restaurants and shops.  From the revolving rooftop restaurant, I could see the runways, and the control tower.
--------------------
Great dinner started with a wonderful fresh Caesar salad and bread followed by delicious cheese ravioli with pesto cream sauce. The pesto sauce was perfect, not overpowering the delicate pasta. I also enjoyed the Dunham cabernet. Delicious. Welcome to downtown, Richard's.
--------------------
The decor of this restaurant is pretty modern.  It seems great for people in their 20s.  I had the mahi mahi with pita chips and hummus.  It was really good.  The fish was tender and flavorful.  The service was good, too.
--------------------
Place for latest night eats around and drive through is a must. New menu items and some veggie options etc. forgot to put my dessert order in the bag though so I was very bummed when I noticed far too late!
--------------------
My go to place in IN when visiting family!  David does the most amazing pink and whites!  The shop is clean and the staff are professional and courteous.  The new management is outstanding (well three years ago but new to me).
--------------------
Boulevard Pizza is our go to place in the Sparks/Reno area. It looks like the decor has not changed since 1985, but who cares when they serve you a pizza this delicious! They have some fun arcade games for the kids.
--------------------
Love going here for happy hour or dinner!  Great patio with fans to beat the StL heat!   Also...very accomodating at this location.  I like the Veal Milanese but with mixed greens instead of pasta!  they'll modify the menu to suit your taste!
--------------------
Tremendous service (Big shout out to Douglas) that complemented the delicious food. Pretty expensive establishment (40-50$ avg for your main course), but its definitely backs that up with an atmosphere that's comparable with any of the top tier restaurants across the country.
--------------------
HOLY SMOKES!

actual pumpkin pie mixed in with the frozen custard......are you kidding me? Why hasn't this become a huge sweep the nation treat. 

The best part was the chunks of pie crust. Like finding a diamond inside another diamond. Super yummy.
--------------------
This is one of the busiest Chick fil A's I've seen but they always manage to be quick and have exceptional service! I seriously don't know how they can be so quick and great all the time! One of my favorite places!
--------------------
Cindy is the best! Great food and service. Food is authentic and so is the staff. Everything is made fresh and you can taste the difference from other Mexican restaurants at first bite. I would recommend to anyone that enjoys Mexican cuisine.
--------------------
Called in a Mediterranean chicken shawarma. Good flavor and they were generous with the amount of chicken in the pita. The food was ready to go when I arrived. Good service. I would revisit the next time I am in the area.
--------------------
Best iced latte and beignet we tried. The live music also creates a great atmosphere. We also visited Cafe du Monde but in our opinion Cafe Beignet is much better. The service is also very good and there are hardly ever lines.
--------------------
Called in to get service information on my 2015 $110K AMG. Was told since I didn't purchase the vehicle at their dealership that I would have to pay for a loaner car for warranty work. Will be staying far away from here.
--------------------
Out lunch today was pulled pork, smokehouse bowl, and delicious sides of sweet potato casserole and red beans and rice.   Red beans and rice was spicy but good. Sweet potato casserole yummy and meat was smoky juicy and plentiful. Definitely a must.
--------------------
Got an estimate but went with another plumber as this was the highest quote of the 3 plumbers we interviewed for the job.
Very prompt communication though.

Will re-consider for future jobs.  Seems reliable (and often you get what you pay for!)
--------------------
I love this place. Super friendly staff. Great with kids. And the food is amazing. Especially the hash browns. You can also get tomatoes and grits on the side. Yum! And on top of it all it's not hard on the wallet.
--------------------
I had chicken BBQ burritos with all kinds of stuff that I like. I love the it ! Good place to sit down with family & had a meal. I wish they had a place for kids to play that would be even better !
--------------------
I visited the new Paoli location. BIG selection of tasty donuts. It's about time--the cardboard impostors found at Dunkin are so lame compared to these beauties. Salted Caramel, Bacon Maple, Lemon--now you're talking my language. Breakfast sandwiches, muffins, and bagels, oh my.
--------------------
Had a great lunch here. I ordered a chicken Caesar and my dining companion ordered a custom salad. Waitress had a great personality and did not rush us at all. Allowed us to linger. Great space which is hidden from the outside.
--------------------
Hands down the best veggie wings I've had anywhere. Seriously. I can never stop thinking about them. Their fried pickles are also great, though I've found their drinks to be a bit weak. I'll stick to a Mexican coke whenever I'm here.
--------------------
I am conflicted about this. Driver was so sweet and polite and the pizza was delicious BUT it was BARELY warm. This is the second time this has happened. I hope they fix it, but for now I will try somewhere else.
--------------------
Heather was my waitress and a bartender.
Everything I tried was fabulous.
I had tenderloin sliders with the french fries oh my.
God I will be going back here as often as I possibly can

You will not regret trying this place
--------------------
Honestly the food doesn't knock my socks off but other people seem to love this place. I go because my husband likes it as for me I'd rather go to a different BBQ spot. I guess it also depends on what you order.
--------------------
This place was so chill and relaxing. When I come back it'll definitely be in my list if stops. Not to mention the artist performing was fun and eclectic  (I mean really, a country version of "Let It Go", what's not to love?)
--------------------
It's was okay service was a bit on the interesting side as the person was new. Food presentation was good though they need to either add rice or more potato salad to the gumbo. Sprite was flat but I didn't need it anyways.
--------------------
Overpriced for what you get. I think this is a cute spot to meet up with a friend, but that's about it. I prefer my own homemade coffee to be honest. Adorable concept, just could use some improvement to products offered and prices.
--------------------
If you want shotty work and bad attitudes, this is the place for you. Mediocre for toes and poor for fingers. And don't try to make any suggestions or corrections without getting an attitude in returned and then talked about in another language.
--------------------
Really good, really authentic! This is some of the BEST Mexican cuisine I've tasted since my nana cooked for me; I'm from California so I would know. The enchiladas w/mole are awesome and the carne asada tacos remind me of Rosarito Beach, yummy!
--------------------
Updating previous trip- I still would take my kids there but the derma bond sucked. Poor buddy has a scar. Yea, yea...it's in a bad spot. And he's not quite two (read: squirmy.) 

I don't think it's too much to want it all. 

 :-/
--------------------
Excited to have this place in Reno! Delicious matcha and ube flavors! Like authentic. Friendly staff, looking to get better but what they have as a base is solid. Soft serve, cake and the sauces aren't overly sweet.  Hoping they add more flavors!
--------------------
This salon is filthy.  There are cobwebs and dust every where.  The equipment is old and in disrepair.  My nail technician was actually watching you tube videos while doing my nails!  I do not know how the health department hasn't shut them down.
--------------------
Went to see Anders Osborne play here & it was a highlight of my trip to NOLA.  Streetcar went straight down to Bourbon after the show but I wish I'd stayed longer! Food smelled awesome, drinks were very reasonably priced  & the crowd was mellow.
--------------------
This place is good. For the lofty prices the proportions were very small. However the drinks were cheap and the service was very good. The piano is a nice touch as well. 

The cheesecake is incredible, just get it and don't look back.
--------------------
I've only had the cannolis here but they are awesome! They're freshly filled when ordered and the filling is phenomenal. Not too sweet, it's perfect. If you like cannoli, if you don't think you like cannoli, you should definitely get one from Termini Bros.
--------------------
I had the pleasure to meet with Ann today and not only was she extremely helpful and so positive, she went above and beyond to make my 1st experience here amazing and made it a absolute regular customer from this day forward. Thanks girlie!!
--------------------
A menu that satisfies everyone's cravings! Clean, trendy, and delicious! I definitely recommend going early (before 9 am) as the wait tends to get longer after 9 am! But honestly, it is soooo worth the wait. You will leave there feeling so incredible satisfied!
--------------------
Worst place I've ever visited. The bouncer was rude and he didn't have to be. This place thinks just cause your on broadway you can treat people bad and over charge. 
 I'm not a tourist I live here and will never visit or recommend
--------------------
My husband had the 6 oz pepperloin meal and was very happy with it. I had the shrimp kabob meal. There were only 4 shrimp and they were more then well done and very small.  The service was good. The restaurant was not busy.
--------------------
Awesome food, great place to split a bunch of delicious spicy, ultra flavorful dishes with a large group. It's the Chinese restaurant a lot of people know about for good reason - I haven't had a single bad dish here, and it's always a crowd-pleaser.
--------------------
Don't go here. They gave me grief over the groupon then didn't bother to actually change my oil filter or tell me that they hadn't changed it so I drove 5k miles on an old filter. Crappy customer service, rude attitude, find somewhere better.
--------------------
A definite go-to place if you're in Treasure Island! Love the char-grilled oysters!  Great staff!  Big outdoor seating area and best yet, it's pet friendly so bring your pup!!!  Coming from Austin where pets are accepted everywhere this is a real bonus for me!
--------------------
Loved the abvionce.. got pampered and relaxed. It was hard to get a drink order place. Was the only reason I did not give them a 5. Had to ask 4 people before I was told to go call roommservice on the white phone.
--------------------
Melissa is by far the BEST! I've gone to two other lash lounges and I will tell you Melissa outdoes them all. She knows her craft. She doesn't double or triple stack lashes. She gets you in and out. 100% recommend going to Melissa.
--------------------
Very nice, quiet and dark restaurant. Chinese and sushi offered. Had szechuan chicken, hot and sour soup, and steamed rice. Hubbie had the prime rib and shrimp hot pot. Just the right amount of food. Didn't have to take any home. Service was excellent.
--------------------
Butch did a great job. The tour was relaxing, informative but 2 good stops to eat and see the cemetery. I recommend going on this trip the beginning of your stay so you know where to go during your trip. He'a also pretty fun.
--------------------
Beautiful modern place, they have a nice view, the only thing is that is close to the train and you may hear it if you are on that side of the building, other than that it's great and has a yolk on the corner!
--------------------
This place is just the best. If you really have to ask why it's all in the name itself. If u don't like chicken then don't come here bc their birds are fly! Don't forget to try their fried corn on the cobs. It's dank!
--------------------
Very impressed with this place! The food was amazing. Quick service chipotle style line ordering but with high-quality Indian food. Also the staff was super helpful in helping me decide what to get since I'm an Indian food newbie. Can't wait to eat there again!
--------------------
The catfish, chicken, gumbo and mac &a cheese are all to die for. We are the lunch buffet and everything was piping hot and fresh. This place was recommended by a local in the neighborhood we are staying in and it was so worth it!
--------------------
They have a couple of really nice ladies, that go out of their way to help you. But there's one that will rip your head off if you're not careful. It won't take ya long to figure this out on your own though.  Jus' sayin'......
--------------------
This place is disappointing for a 4.5 star rating. The burgers were so-so. The vibe felt very much like a chain restaurant like Red Robin. We did go on a Tuesday night so perhaps it's better on the weekends? Either way, we won't be back.
--------------------
Oh man! This is the spot right here! Everything is made to order and sooo worth the wait. I'm from Chicago and have been a self proclaimed sandwich expert for most of my life...this place deserves every bit of those 5 stars! Well done guys!
--------------------
Great variety of coffees and teas. My current favorite is the iced dirty chai. The staff is very nice and acknowledges your existence without making a person feel rushed. Table sizes for everyone! They also feature local artists art to purchase. I enjoy the vibe.
--------------------
I eat at Pina's or take-out about once a month. My favorites includes their dinner specials, cheesesteaks, calzones, and seafood dishes. The shrimp scampi appetizer (sans linguini) and steamed clams are excellent  inexpensive. Service is always flawless. For casual dining this place is very good.
--------------------
3.5 stars because they don't serve alcohol (and I was in dire need of a drink after a veryyyy long week). Get the margherita pie - it is delicious and fresh. Also ordered the Greek salad for an appetizer which was filled with yummy veggies. Yum.
--------------------
Freddy's has the best fast-food style burgers I've ever had. Great toppings choices and fresh meat. Their fries are delicious with their "fry" sauce. Their custard is just as good as their food. It's rich and creamy, and did I mention how delicious it is.
--------------------
The people at the store amazing! We came in to exchange a shirt from a few days before they had had some damage, and the managers were so helpful with our situation. Tonya is the best. Without hesitation she is going to help us out.
--------------------
The kayaking tour at the Santa Cruz Island was great.  My husband and I had a wonderful time.  Jen, our tour guide, was helpful and informative.  We had a lot of fun exploring the caves.  We didn't expect much but this tour definitely exceeded our expectation.
--------------------
I went to the pearl for my birthday and every detail of the experience was awesome!  The food, the wine and the service were all impeccable!  We didn't realize the time and were chatting away after closing time and the staff never made us feel rushed.
--------------------
Dr. Curtis Dechant has an excellent chair-side manner, and he establishes a good rapport with his patients. The office is very comfortable, and the latest high-tech equipment makes eye appointments much easier to bear. I also appreciate their selection of eyeglass frames and the friendly staff.
--------------------
I absolutely love EVAN he's the best guy ever. If he wasn't the door guy I don't know what people would do with themselves!!! He is one of the most awesome
People that I Know !!! If It wasn't for Evan I probably wouldn't come to OMALLZ
--------------------
I love Doan's. It's the kind of place you have a "usual" and every time you have it, it's just as good as the last time. They staff is friendly and speedy so if you don't have a long lunch it's a great place to go.
--------------------
Attended a party there. They now have a private room with your own bar and bathroom. I really enjoyed it. The buffet was good, didn't have to wait for a drink and you were able to hear each other talk. I would have a party there!
--------------------
Love the sweet spiral plain pies at Franzones.  Can't go wrong with plain.  I tried the white pizza with onions in addition and it was a pleasant surprise.  The onions were a great addition to the pizza.  Same Franzone's as the Bridgeport one I grew up with.
--------------------
This is the place for authentic Indian street food. I've been here multiple times ordering different things ranging from bhel puri, pav bhaji, vada pav, deconstructed samosa and aloo tikki, dabeli, kulfi and more. Everything was made exceptionally well.

I regret not having found this place sooner.
--------------------
Even after finding many great Spanish restaurants in the country (mostly NYC), Modesto is still one of my favorite Spanish place to eat.  This place is really good!  Too bad I don't live near St. Louis anymore since this is one of the places that I miss.
--------------------
Simply put .. Awesome . Surrounded by lakes , the apartment complex has very peaceful environment . The staff of the leasing office are very helpful and friendly. I had very nice experience staying here and would recommend the apartment to anyone who is looking for peaceful  stay in St. Petersburg,FL.
--------------------
The bouncers are awful, but I would be too if I were 4-feet tall and had an infinite amount of pent-up aggression and shielded childhood memories. 

This place stands for everything Reno shouldn't be. Choose LEX only if the sole alternative is being waterboarded during thanksgiving dinner.
--------------------
The cafe was extremely cute. We came at 8am and they even had a jazz band playing at that time. I got the breakfast sandwich and it was delicious. I loved how they rolled the egg and put the bacon pieces inside. Great price for a filling breakfast!
--------------------
Dine-in gets 2 stars. Disappointing service & venue falls short. 

The food was ok; so if you were to do take out, maybe this place would get 3 stars. 

I ordered the lamb kebab, which tasted ok; but it was very plain. No sauces, lettuce or anything - just meat.
--------------------
I got the gyro "platter" for lunch, which was dry, uninspired, and nothing like a deconstructed gyro. Worst of all, it came with "vegetables" which looked more like poop. Tasted that way, too. There are better places in Fairmount for lunch, and they won't serve you poop, either.
--------------------
A small aquarium that is interesting mainly for kids.  They have a shark feeding show and stingrays that you can pet and buy food to feed.  It is not the first place i would go in Tarpon Springa, but it is ok, small children seem to like it.
--------------------
Come here for delicious, home style New Orleans cuisine. We went in the afternoon, and although it was full, we were lucky and a table was ready right away. We did the a la carte as opposed to the buffet. It was our favorite meal of the trip!
--------------------
Worst experience ever!!!! 

I stood in line today for 1 hour and 20 minutes for 1 shot. They the walked up in front of me and closed the line. Told me they were done and leaving. There were 60 people behind me outraged as well. F*** this place
--------------------
The best fried rice ever! Also the best Pho I had while in Nashville. I'm from Seattle so I'm a little spoiled in that department. If you're looking for a good place to try it for the first time or just looking for a good Vietnamese restaurant, GO!
--------------------
Awesome! Loved this place. Great little breakfast joint easy walk south of route 90. Easy walk from French Quarter and surrounding areas. We got the bananas foster and it was incredible. Great decorations and colorful setting that feels like how you'd expect New Orleans to feel. Highly recommend.
--------------------
A great lunch or dinner stop in Reno, NV.  

We've had some fine meals in this establishment......Tyler (manager) does a great job with his staff, and it shows in the overall results.

They are also a pub, so its got a great selection of beers and wines too!
--------------------
The food was good, service was horrible. I ordered orange juice for my kids and waited till we were almost done eating then finally got the juices. They take cash or checks only. Everything else was OK, but they could do a little bit better on their service.
--------------------
Amazing place for lassi and chaat. The chaat is elegantly presented and tastes like traditional Karachi chaat. However, the chaat isn't as nearly as good as the lassi. It is soft and creamy and sweetened beautifully. Will be coming back for sure next time I'm in the area.
--------------------
This was a nice spot with sidewalk lounge seating. Even had a DJ outside Friday night. There was a walk up bar outside too. The decor inside was pretty sweet. We tried a few appetizers and they were both good! It is located in a trendy waterfront area.
--------------------
I've been to Lush in Arizona, S.F., San Jose and Maui. The one in New Orleans is My favorite one. I love how you can smell a Lush store from a block away. :) I've been to this one a few times, Always on Halloween. Always a fun time :)
--------------------
Always awesome!  Best crust ever and super Fresh ingredients and nice staff.  Lots of yummy toppings that aren't offered at other pizza places.   Great salads too! Patio area is a cool place to kick back,have a beer or glass of wine and savor the best pizza in town.
--------------------
I have purchased tires from Tires Plus in Flourtown at least 4 times. On this visit they mounted 4 new Michelins that I supplied. My car was worked on as soon as I arrived for the scheduled appointment at 9:00 and was returned to me within one hour.
--------------------
great hotel in a very good location. The staff was really friendly, and helped us out a lot. it's a 1-2 minute walk to the bars on Bourbon, 7-8 min walk to Harra's, 10 min walk to Jackson Square. The only downside is parking is $38 a night.
--------------------
We had a 2 1/2 day corporate conference here in the middle of June. The service was excellent, the facilities were very nice and I was fairly impressed with catering. Great spot for conferences or small conventions. Close to the airpor with a complimentary shuttle and complimentary parking.
--------------------
I had a most-delicious bagel sandwich this morning - pork roll, egg and cheese on an everything bagel. The price was very fair - $4.23 - and the bagels are made on site each day. They seem understaffed so hopefully they get some more staff to keep up with the crowds.
--------------------
The service was good and the staff was polite, but the food was bland and lacked flavor. The drinks were ok about what you would expect of a chain restaurant. If you are looking for somewhere to sit Down for a quick lunch this might be your place.
--------------------
Skip this train wreck if you are looking for dinner.  Our server was clueless...like we seriously thought she was lost in the restaurant.  Had to ask for setups, water refills, etc.  Ordered chicken parmesan and got eggplant parmesan instead with a fish bone in it.  The drinks were good.
--------------------
I can only comment on the vermicelli bowls because I have never had the Pho. 

The vermicelli are a decent size and a fair price. Conveniently located if you live in the Alberta Ave neighbourhood, my orders have always been ready in 15 minutes - even on a Friday night.
--------------------
We set up an online appt, meeting and transaction was very simple and painless. We opted for a 2hr side by side ride where we had a four-seater with our guide Matt (who by the way was super awesome and informative).  Throughly enjoyed our ride with some superb views.
--------------------
It's really a run of the middle as far as Cuban food goes. Not bad but not great either. I work close by so I end up there for lunch quite a bit. It's definitely worth checking out for lunch as their specials change every day and prepared freshly.
--------------------
Like wholefoods but much smaller. They have all sorts of stuff from Salad bar, to a small selection of fresh fruits, juice bar. Great lil grocery store. Couldn't really find any other in the city. They have a parking lot. Great walking, just a couple blocks from clothing stores
--------------------
We stopped in for brunch and we weren't expecting the food to be so delicious.  The 3 meat hash was amazing, as was the turkey sandwich and bagel/salmon.  The employees were very friendly and accommodating.  A little pricey, but well worth.  We will visit again if in the area.
--------------------
Hendricks is a must try in St.Louis. The meats,sauces,and sides are better than most barbecue places.Onion rings are huge and the coleslaw is tasty and finely shredded. Service is good and very friendly. Takes awhile to get the meal,but it gives you time to check out the unique decor.
--------------------
Tina I believe was our waitress.. I'm not sure if I want to give 3 or 4 stars. Its just that the initial wait was kinda long. But it was my first time eating the food and I thought it was pretty good. I liked my side salad too!
--------------------
I stopped at Walgreens in hopes of seeing the new ELF Villain's collection. Sometimes Walgreens gets them before the holidays. Sometimes they don't. This particular one doesn't ever get them according to their cosmetics person. SAD. Really sad. I suppose I'll have to skulk other Walgreens to find them.
--------------------
terrible food and the manager was shockingly rude when I tried to return my food. I had the frogs legs and they were rubbery and tasted awful. I was disgusted by her behavior and she should be ashamed of herself. I have never been treated more horribly by someone.
--------------------
Yummy food,  they will veganize things for you as well. The servers are friendly and the restaurant is spacious and has a bar and a stage area. We have had our work Holiday party here for the past couple years, both parties turned out great. The guacamole is awesome!
--------------------
I'm picky when it comes to pizza, and Brixx is a win every time! I love that their menu incorporates gluten-free options and perfectly sized lunch options. The wrap around bar also makes it the perfect stop to unwind after work, but arrive early, their patio fills up quickly!
--------------------
This place has went down hill to me. At first, when it was just the owner at the one store on linbergh, the food was amazing. It seems since he started branching out, the service and food has not been up to par. I think they lost my service.
--------------------
Really not sure what the hype was when it opened. It's fine, the ambiance was nice, but the menu is limited and food is nothing to write home about. They are in a nice location so at least if you decide to wait, then you have things to see...
--------------------
Not sure the significance behind the name and logo of the restaurant.  Unless it was three guys putting their money together to form this business 
The food was great/ staff friendly/ huge menu from breakfast /lunch/dinner to dessert.   Open 24 hours will definitely be back next time in town
--------------------
Calories and diabetes be damned - fewer things could be better than gelati on days as brutally hot as the ones we've had this week.  Thanks for helping to cool us all down w your frozen treats.  Five stars for you.

PS - visit the website for a little Vanilla Ice.
--------------------
Hands down great guys, we have relocated to the area and have older cars. With that age comes quirks, I great appreciate their honesty, hard work and communication of the situation at hand.  Attention to detail is never messed and I highly recommend this shop for any service needs.
--------------------
First time here and I'm not disappointed. Great seasoning on the seafood. I ordered oysters and their $45 combo and some garlic chicken wings for a family of six. It was more than enough for us. Only thing I can complain about is she messed up on our order.
--------------------
Highly, highly overrated.  The food was a C minus at best.  And the service was so bad that I may never go back.  They screwed up my order completely and my no apologies.  There are a lot of other options around State Street.  Avoid this place like the plague.
--------------------
Sometimes this food is very very good.  Unfortunately it's not consistent.   Ordered something I've been getting for years and every other time it tastes incredible. It's like they have different people in the kitchen and you don't know who you will get. So 50 % of the time it's excellent.  UGH.
--------------------
My friends at work (connoisseurs of good food in the St. Louis area) introduced me to yet another very nice restaurant and that's Brio's!! I like everything about it - starting from the complimentary bread and chips to the bruschetta, pasta and salads !! Beautiful place.. The service adds to the charm !!
--------------------
This was a cool place to stop by and check out the birds on a Sunday morning.  

My daughter and I have stopped in here a couple of times so she can look at the birds.  Very friendly staff.

If you're a bird person this is the place to go.
--------------------
Always excellent service and amazing food. The staff is is always friendly and there are many promotions that always keep us coming back. The quality of the fish is amazing and the perfect portion size of the rolls allows you to try many different kinds. Out favorite sushi in town!
--------------------
Love the food. Big portions, interesting and ever changing menue. The only issues i have are that the seating is cramped, too loud for conversation and the coffe is not as good as Sabrina's.

The latkas are always perfect and the bacon is the best I ahve had in Philly.
--------------------
Love!! Our new favorite local spot. We've gone a few times since they opened and it's always a good ambiance, and great food. The drinks are great, the salsa is super yummy, and the salads are very much entree sized. Bring your friends, sit outside, grab a margarita and enjoy!
--------------------
Dave was very nice and explained the menu, the dogs were whipped up fast and were delicious, hit the spot. Dave's special, pizza dog and a custom creation were all excellent and he threw in some grilled jalapeños too. Santa Barbara desperately needs more late night food carts like this.
--------------------
Literally, the worst Taco Bell I have ever been to. The restaurant is filthy, the service is awful, and they didn't make any of our order correctly, and really, how hard is that?  I won't be back and if I were you I would find a different place to go.
--------------------
Cool spot in a great location.
We got there early, so didn't have the same crushing crowds others have talked about.
The bartenders are awesome.
Made me a Perfect Rye Manhattan on the rocks, never had one before...I'm hooked.
Easily the best burger I've ever had!
Will absolutely be back
--------------------
Delicious top shelf pastries. I am outraged at the poor ratings. If you're looking for cheapness over flavor then go to Panera. Service has always been exceedingly pleasent when I go, and I am an obnoxious needy customer. We are so excited to have them make macaroons for our wedding.
--------------------
My friends and I all got one of each that were available to try out. I love the many fun donut flavors they have there. The thing that stood out to me was their fried chicken. I got the chicken sandwich and it was SO GOOD. I highly recommend it.
--------------------
In love with my haircut! Very reasonable prices as well. This is my second time here. The first time the cut and style were amazing but the color was a little off from what I wanted but it still looked good. I will definitely continue to be a returning customer.
--------------------
Joyce is awesome! Love that this does not hurt at all. We drive from palm harbor to her place, and it well worth the extra time. Her machine is high tech, and the horror stories my friends told me of their experience ,, makes me love this even more! Love it!
--------------------
Traveling through in our RV, stopped over in Granite City. Found this little gem of a cafe. Upon entering, the staff was very sweet and friendly. This is like home cooking. We ate here twice and all our food choices were fresh, delicious and like we would fix at home. Yum.
--------------------
The espresso here is excellent. My favorite place to come for an Americano. The staff is polite and friendly and vibes are mellow. It is important to know that there is no access to power outlets, but unlimited wifi access. The bathrooms and the rest of the establishment are always clean.
--------------------
The burgers were very good very flavorful. I had the El Mariachi. As with what other reviewers have said the portion is not big. But I believe it makes up in flavor. I also have salted caramel ice cream it was very good homemade style. I do recommend the rooster sauce.
--------------------
I grew up eating beef sandwiches in Chicago, and this place makes the best beef I've ever had outside of the city. 

Couple of suggestions: Offer a third sandwich size option (bigger!), get sweet peppers, serve fries(!!!), keep the main location off of Mass Ave open year-round, and have longer hours!
--------------------
Lots and lots of mostly fried seafood. Surprisingly expensive for a working class joint. It's the kind of place a dock worker would take his family for a fancy meal and not feel out of place. And it's definitely a New Orleans sort of experience. But the food isn't that great.
--------------------
I've eaten here numerous times and every time it's been absolutely fantastic. Great food, nice people, calm and quiet place. Their crepes are the best crepes I have ever had. Amazingly delicious. I recommend this place to my friends all the time. I've always heard great things from them as well.
--------------------
Went there for lunch and was pleasantly surprised, as having recently moved to Tampa from Los Angeles, I have been disappointed by the food.  However, I give Ploy Thai 4 stars, not just by Tampa standards, but by good food standards.  The food was very flavorful and the ingredients very fresh.
--------------------
Nice location and very friendly device. The restaurant feels like you could actually be dining in Ethiopian. The food however is probably a 6/10 based on several other Ethiopian restaurants we have eaten at. The lack flavor and taste. It's a reasonable restaurant for sure but again quite average - nothing special.
--------------------
Katie's is a neighborhood restaurant that has existed in one form or another for a few generation.  It's classic New Orleans fare with an Italian-American slant.  Great meatballs.  You'll see all types of classic New Orleans old people dinging before 8pm.   You won't be disappointed if your expectations aren't too high.
--------------------
The TV shows are $4.99 and they have commercials! What a cheesy way to make money and a sign of a less than classy hotel, particularly when you pay more than $150 a night.  And there is NO complimentary breakfast, just an overpriced buffet, something even the cheapest hotels in California provide.
--------------------
I am a huge fan of Gennaro's. It's got a thin crust, sweet and rich tomato sauce along w fresh mozzarella cheese. Also, the meatballs are excellent. Can't say enough about how much I love it here. Also, the decor is vintage and adorable. 

I have yet to be disappointed with Gennaro's
--------------------
Great atmosphere, service was very friendly and prices were very reasonable however I found the food a bit bland, not bad just bland. My husband and I were starving after a long drive to Philly and this filled the spot but it wasn't overly enjoyable and we most likely won't be back.
--------------------
I am not an indian food type of person but this place lives up to the hype. When you go, just let Hassan make something for you, don't try and overwhelm yourself with the different options. Make sure to get a chaat and a lassi as the two really complement one another.
--------------------
I love Italian food and with this being so close to home, I gave it a shot. Not only did they exceed my expectations in food quality and quantity, but every time we order pick up, or dine in the girls treat us amazing (You rock Alexa!) Thank you for being awesome.
--------------------
This is our go-to takeout place. It has great food and exceptionally fast service. I live at 2601 Parkway and they deliver right to the door of my condo which many delivery places don't do. Their staff is friendly, make great pizza, and generally run such a business as best you can.
--------------------
Rude staff. Can't even get a salad order right. Overpriced by the slice. When we sat down to wait for our food I thought wow this is taking a long time given the fact we were the only people in there. I guess it should stay that way. Don't waste your money.
--------------------
Went on a Monday to have a daiquiri and watch a little bit of the NBA basketball game.  Asked the young lady working if she would be willing to turn on the game and was told she was watching Netflix.  I guess customer service is not important anymore.  Won't ever go back.
--------------------
Not impressed at all. Sandwich bar was closed so I ordered a burrito. It was reheated in the microwave, cost 8 bucks, and nasty. Some sort of cream of chicken and old cheese on top. I'm amazed they can sell this and call it food. Could have had better at taco bell.
--------------------
First visit tonight. Nice, clean place. Reasonably priced. Friendly staff. Excellent presentation of extremely bland, mediocre food. I ordered the chicken fajitas. Onions and pepper base (warm) on a tepid fajita platter. Meat, room temperature. Pico, cheese, sour cream, tortillas were nothing special. I was underwhelmed. I don't think I'll be back.
--------------------
I am a groupie. He is amazing. I am sad that I got to have his dish only once. Now all construction on market I can't find him!!

His chicken is the most tender and smoky I've ever had. Side dishes are creative and awesome too. 
I hope he is back soon.
--------------------
After always shopping at the Randall's off Jefferson, it was nice to see West County get their own Randall's. Staff here is uber friendly and helpful. Beer selection is solid here, with plenty of styles to choose from.Prices are competitive with the other beer markets around. Well worth your time and money.
--------------------
The loose tea can get expensive, 
but I love getting ready made teas, pretty wide selection, always something new and they let you mix to make your own concoction, always comes out perfect!
The staff are the nicest people around. They remember me when I come in and remember what I like :-)
--------------------
Man. This place is nice. The bartender was awesome. Try the burger. It's fresh with all local ingredients. The plates of food I saw come out looked amazing as well. 

The beer is cold. The drinks are mixed perfectly.  This is not a chain restaurant but a dedicated local place with good employees.
--------------------
Buckingham Pizza makes the best pizza around, particularly its plain pizza and a few of its specialities -- try the cool ranch pizza. This is a pizza parlor. Don't get fancy....order the pizzas and maybe some sides. While some of the entrees are good (chicken piccata), stay with the pizza and you'll love it.
--------------------
This place is game changer for the neighborhood. We got some take out tonight and the food was absolutely  delicious.  I'm really stoked they moved in and I'm newly smitted by southern Latin food.  The family who owns it also seem very sweet! 
I think this place is exactly  what the neighborhood needed!
--------------------
I've always had good experiences here. The food is creative and tasty and the house wines are decent. Their cocktails are well made but small. I've never had a problem with service but also haven't been here during a super busy time. The patio is a great spot to hang out with friends.
--------------------
Came with the family based on a recommendation and was not disappointed.  I consider myself to be a bit of a Pizza connoisseur and this was right up there.  The staff was friendly and the food came out quick.  Solid experience across the board.  I would come back and recommend it to others.
--------------------
Good Chinese food and really nice beer selection.  Haven't tried the sushi yet, so I can't speak to that.  True, the staff isn't exactly the most cordial, but they're plenty nice enough for Chinese food take out.  This is not an expensive or fancy restaurant, so you should go in with reasonable expectations.
--------------------
Awesome location, good service is why I have been eating there for the past 15 years off and on. Mostly the excuses about the steak is why I have to write the review. I am happy to pay more for good quality steak but don't blame the poor guy that sold it to you !
--------------------
Fast.  Fresh.  The carne was very good.  So was the guacamole.  Wish there was the ability to customize taco toppings.  The tortilla chips were too thick.  The dulche de leche  soft serve ice cream was amazingly delicious.  Wish that there was more seating.  Wish that table clean ups were more timely and more thorough.
--------------------
I like the Neuvo-Latino-Americano grub here.  The place has moved locations and is now a bit larger.  Chips & Salsa are always fresh 7 tasty, too.

I wish I could give a more substanital review but I ate here so long ago - and at the old location - so I'd better just keep my mouth shut.
--------------------
I love Mr. Wizard's because they offer frozen yogurt which is a  lot healthier than frozen custard. I like that they offer some pre-select combinations or you can create your own. The only part that sucks is that there is only outside seating so if it's cold outside, plan to eat in your car.
--------------------
Eh, crust was dry and we got the Delmar which instead of pizza sauce they use bbq sauce however they barely put any on the pizza which caused it to be dry. The server was good. The pizza took forrrevvverrr to come out though we had been done with our salads for 20-30 minutes.
--------------------
If you beat the crowd you're in. Small but that's the only negative. Everything I've tried on the menu is AMAZING! They even have vegetarian/vegan items. I always get whatever french toast special they have. I always take people who stay with me for Mardi Gras here for breakfast before we hit the parades.
--------------------
Family diner. Had the buffet. Eclectic assortment: a large chicken leg, fried jalapeño, tamale, two rolled grape leaves, fresh melon. All good. Lots of Mexican choices there. Also has a menu with breakfast served all day long. Friendly, attentive staff. Good place for a casual relaxed meal with no expectations. Next to the Clarion Hotel.
--------------------
Been here so many times before and all I can say is the food is really good. A hidden gem in Florissant, it has the best Panang curry around. Haven't been to their sister restaurant yet, but I can't seem to want to move on when I am always so satisfied with their fare here.
--------------------
Don't know what it is but If my tummy's feeling icky, I can count on Chipotle's stake to fix me up. I just have to remember not to go during full on lunch time. I usually go between 2 & 4 when it's peaceful and calm. Busy or not the service is always friendly and fast!
--------------------
Paid for non-smoking room but there was a smell and ashtrays in the room. Since all we were doing was sleeping there we didn't say anything. Shower was crazy slow to drain. Pillows were so lumpy that I woke up with a migraine. Room was clean and staff was nice. Free wifi but wouldn't connect.
--------------------
I've been to this place in numerous occasions and I have never been disappointed! My friend and I are traveling to Puerto Rico and my mother in law wanted Tamales! They were very accommodating and gave us free samples and offer to cook them and pack them for us! Great place and very friendly staff!
--------------------
Wow. We visited NOLA last week and took the truly awesome and informative  Steamboat Natchez trip on March 30. Can't tell you how interesting it was and pleasant. Plus these people are so well-organized and nice. JoJo reserved us a window seat - just could not believe the kind and excellent service. 
Very very nice.  Recommend!!!!
--------------------
Best casino in Reno.   4 deck and 2 deck blackjack, real drink glasses (no plastic fratboy cups), amazing decorum that will burn your retinas, and the restaurants inside are better the big casinos on the strip by a factor of a thousand.
The rooms are stellar for the price.  Get a hot tub and chilllllll.
--------------------
Beers were amazing! I got the porter, the double IPA and the table gutt and they were all fantastic. Food was also killer if you like Russian cuisine. They had a special when I went with a sausage and sauerkraut which was tasty. I also got the pickled everything appetizer, great choice. This place rules.
--------------------
Seriously one of the most pleasant dining experiences I have had in a while. Smiley himself is a true gem and the food was DELICIOUS. Had so much that I am eating it for lunch again today - and I can't wait! Please recommend to everyone you know in Manayunk, don't want to lose this place!
--------------------
My dad and I are on a cross country trip and one of our first stops was Saguaro National Park. 
We did a quick tour with Park Ranger Carolyn and loved it. She was incredibly enthusiastic and passionate about her studies on the saguaro and she was very knowledgeable. Definitely recommend both the tour and Carolyn.
--------------------
Went here for dinner on opening day and was SO HAPPY I DID!! Great atmosphere, lovely staff, and food on fleek!! Green tea (PHO PHREE) was so satisfying, summer rolls and spicy peanut sauce were DELISH, and pho was PHONOMENAL! Definitely making this one of my regular hot spotz as I eat my way through Fairmount!
--------------------
Don't let the shopping center location deter you! Amazing place and even a more amazing staff. Curtis is the true epitome of great service. Loves his job and wants nothing more than for you to enjoy your dining experience. Try the scallops small plate, you won't regret it, but the whole dining experience is top notch.
--------------------
Our office went today for Friday's happy hour special.  Such a great deal, and it wasn't packed.  Didn't expect it, but the food and drinks on their specials-amazing!  Usually the happy hour offerings wouldn't be. Definitely try the pork sliders and the beignets for dessert.  Really fun time and great atmosphere.

Staff was very friendly too!
--------------------
Great professional tat shop!! My husband and I are very happy with our new ink. Bryan did an outstanding job and I highly recommend him. All the employees were super nice and I can see why this is the city's #1 tattoo shop. Don't forget their new location is 1418 N. Clairborne, in Suite 5, upstairs.
--------------------
This place was nice, clean, and bright. It's your typical serve-yourself fro yo bar with several choices for frozen yogurt and a topping station. The cashier was very (berry?) nice and let me pay via credit card even though I was a few cents short of the minimum. I'd say my son enjoyed his time here.
--------------------
Peppermill has done it again with service and accommodations that are second to none.  Gaming at the mill (i only play 1 dollar or 25 cent slots) seems to provide better outcomes and I know reno. Spent a lot here and found the peppermill is the best. Food is some of the best and reasonably priced.
--------------------
Deseree has done my hair for over a decade and I wouldn't trust anyone else. From blonde to brunette, to long or short, she does it all. She's styling my hair for my upcoming wedding plus 6 bridesmaids and I have no doubt it'll be picture perfect. Deseree is accommodating, dependable,and experienced (oh, and hilarious too )!!
--------------------
Just recently ate here for the first time. The hype was real. My girlfriend had the Greek Salad while I ordered the Chickpea Vegetarian Pita and they were kind enough to allow for some substitutions. The food was on point and portions were very filling and satisfying. Great staff and environment. Will definitely be back again!
--------------------
I'm so incredibly happy with our pictures! Angela Clifton Photography have worked with us 3 times and we have been happy with every single picture that was taken! Not only are the photos fabulous, but we had such a fun experience. The price is extremely reasonable and the pictures will be a keepsake we will cherish forever!
--------------------
The court house is very old and the art is great. The spiral staircase is funny. One can get view of entire city from 5th level. The tower clock room is really surprising with all mechanical gears inside!! You need a prior appointment to get into clock room. Worth spending 2 to 3 hours of time here.
--------------------
This place was so yummy and decently priced. I felt that the escargot would have been better as traditional escargot but the playing was nice. You can dine with the ghost (former owner of the mansion who killed himself on their 2nd floor) for an additional $50. The table is by itself in a cold dungeony room.
--------------------
I didn't really like my sandwich I got here. I got the jalapeño cheese bread and it was tasteless and dry. I could tell it was old. Also I got tomatoes and cucumbers which were mush because they were overripe. Usually they're a lot better than this but today wasn't it. The staff is very friendly though.
--------------------
In Reno for the night. Was a bit skeptical because well..it's Reno, but this place far exceeded expectations. Very good Taiwanese food compared to most places I've tried in different cities. My recommendations: 三杯鸡, oyster omlet, and scallion pancake. 

There are many other dishes I wish I could try. Will definitely miss this place once I leave.
--------------------
I loved this place!  We drove down from Tahoe just to eat here!  The 90 miles round trip was worth it!  The food was that good!  The Chicken Basil was the best!  And they have good Boba Tea!

Don't believe the nay-sayer about this place.  The food was pretty authentic Taiwanese.  Try it and see for yourself!
--------------------
Pros:

-Superb cheeseburger - thick, evenly cooked, (almost) medium rare, nice sauce, soft bun
-Tasty (complimentary) zucchini bread
-Good service
-Good G+T selection
-Cool ambience
-Downstairs from my apartment

Cons:

-Expensive
-Per wife, the waitress "seemed disappointed" that we only ordered cheeseburgers (this was not verified, status as a "con" is under review)

Looking forward to going back.
--------------------
Food was excellent but when asked to honor their yelp offer of 10% off our bill for checking in and reviewing their business, We were told that they would not honor the deal until our next visit even though the yelp countdown said we had 4 hours to redeem the deal. Great food, but bad business practice :(
--------------------
This was hands down the best tuna melt I have ever had. Very clean! This was also the best service I have ever had at a cafe. Awesome service and really on top of things. It's crazy because it is inside the grocery store! They should expand this cafe without the store attached!!! It would be amazing!!
--------------------
This is a great place to bring the kids to. They can have juice, a slice of cake, and homemade popsicles. They think it is a tea party. I have tried everything once and my favorites are the homemade doughnuts filled with read bean, the popsicles, the patbingsu, and even the good ol' coffee cream and sugar.
--------------------
We had a great experience enjoying happy hour here! Vaughn and Mark are so kind, we will absolutely be back to get that same service. It's truly one of a kind. The free appetizer was awesome and the slot machines at the bar brought us luck. What a fun happy hour with amazing service!! It's a must!
--------------------
First, I love that they offer food delivery! Second, THAT is a gyro! I got one delivered with fries, and actually I didn't need the fries! The gyro was so big I had to save half.  Both the fries and the gyro were very tasty. The tzaziki was spot on and the meat tender. I'll be back!
--------------------
This place is awesome the food is dynamite . Super friendly service. And the. Coup de grace was the flan made in house fresh and believe me I've tried flan everywhere, there's is exceptional. The price was right on point. My only suggestion to make this place go into the stratosphere is if they had a liquor license.
--------------------
I was very pleased with my experience here!  Good, fast service--you can linger after your meal because you've paid up front. 

And, most importantly the food is fresh and tasty!  I loved my chicken taco salad and the plantains we got.  The drinks, especially the mojito, were good too. 

Will definitely be back to try more things.
--------------------
Neat diner, unlike other diners as it's quaint and has a good feel to it. I had the Yankee pot roast....which was ok....mashed potatoes were just ok and the meat was kind of bland. The veggies were excellent, fresh, not out of a can.  My wife had an omelette which she said was good. Service was excellent.
--------------------
First time checking it out first breakfast as recommended by a friend! Service was quick and friendly. It was a busy Saturday morning but we got seated right away. I loved the veggie omelette with fruit and rye toast. Overall good selection to fit anyone's tastes. Reasonable prices for the amount of food. Will be back again!
--------------------
Needs some attention in the dining room. Good salad  but skimpy on the bread. No sweet tea .  I noticed a booth with children almost be for at least 30 minutes. One was a sleep. Finally an employee came out to them. She must have brought to work with her. I was concerned because they were small & alone.
--------------------
Chicken was salty, I ordered 1/2 chicken, rice and plantains to go for lunch. With the chicken and rice, I only received 2 pieces of plantains & paid I've $8 for this meal. Totally not worth it. There were great reviews but it was not my day. I will have to think twice before ordering from here again.
--------------------
Yes, this is the only sushi place in town. However, it is great when you're craving sushi and don't have time to go somewhere else. The salmon is probably the best fish they have, so we always order salmon. We also love their spicy edamame, tempura, ocean salad, and cabbage salad. Service has always been friendly and quick!
--------------------
Say you decide that you need a new door...and you only have $35.  Where do you go?  the Green Project. 

Or you have a bunch of left over building supplies, random bits of lumber, some roofing materials, maybe even some paint?  Where can you bring it so it doesn't end up in a landfill?  Again, the Green Project.
--------------------
I LOVE this place!  I have been coming here for a few years now.  Its a little funky, and I would never order say the escargot, for safety reasons, but when it comes to lots of Saki, great rolls, and mountains of rice and Sashimi, this is the way to go.  Young atmosphere, loud dance music, and SAKI!
--------------------
Tried the pulled pork, green beans, Mac n cheese and cornbread. It was all pretty mediocre barbecue. Not bad, not great. The pork was a little overdone/dry, but had a nice smoky flavor. The original bbq sauce is pretty sweet/syrupy. Ill probably go back, but I wouldn't if there was a better option as close to my house.
--------------------
